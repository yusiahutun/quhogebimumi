With his song "Make Me Proud," the Canadian rapper delves deep into the paradoxes of love, ambition, and societal expectations. Through Straussian analysis, we can uncover a narrative that parallels the unexpected journey of a beloved character from a classic television show, "The X-Files."</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Overt Meaning:</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>At first glance, "Make Me Proud" seems to celebrate a woman with ambition and intelligence. Drake professes his admiration for a partner who possesses a mix of a bright future and a rich past. The artist appreciates a woman with an attitude problem, recognizing that it adds depth and longevity to their union. He encourages her not to rush things, but rather to savor the process. Drake further highlights her intelligence, comparing her to a Yale graduate, while acknowledging the possibility that she might have attended Howard University.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Creative Straussian Interpretation:</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>In a surprising revelation, we can interpret "Make Me Proud" through the lens of the enigmatic FBI agent Dana Scully from "The X-Files." Scully, portrayed by Gillian Anderson, exudes strength and intelligence throughout the series, causing viewers to marvel at her poise and capability in the face of the unknown. Like Drake's muse, Scully embodies a union of past and future. Her past as a skilled medical doctor merges with her future as an FBI agent, enabling her to tackle paranormal phenomena with scientific skepticism.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The comparisons continue as both the song and Scully's story touch upon the theme of duality and restraint. Drake's lyrics emphasize the allure of a partner who restrains herself while facing adversities head-on. Scully, too, embodies restraint in challenging situations, refusing to let her emotions cloud her judgment. The contrasting worlds of personal relationships and professional obligations resonate through the characters of Drake's song and Scully in "The X-Files."</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Drake's line, "I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl / Maybe it's just right for the night," can be interpreted as a metaphor for Scully's ceaseless pursuit of truth in the face of darkness. Just as the moon remains a beacon of light amid the night sky, Scully's unwavering commitment to her mission serves as a guiding star amidst the mysteries she encounters.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Alternative Perspectives and Influences:</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The song's chorus allows for alternative perspectives. While Drake praises his partner's resilience, other characters in the song may offer differing viewpoints. In a surprise twist, we can draw parallels between the male characters in the song and the morally ambiguous Walter White from the television show "Breaking Bad." While Drake celebrates his partner's strength, the male characters in "Make Me Proud" might represent those who fail to recognize and appreciate a strong woman. They desire her as a wife but lack the fundamental understanding and admiration she deserves.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Furthermore, the reference to Dolly Parton in Nicki Minaj's verse adds another layer to the song's inspiration. Parton, known for her intelligence and business acumen, represents a woman who defied societal norms and dominated the music industry. Her influence further bolsters the idea of celebrating a strong and ambitious woman, resonating with the overarching narrative of the song.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=true style=white-space:pre-wrap></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Drake's "Make Me Proud" is a multifaceted piece that goes beyond the surface-level celebration of a powerful and intelligent woman. By applying Straussian analysis, we have discovered unexpected connections to the character of Dana Scully from "The X-Files" and the complex dynamics in "Breaking Bad." The song's exploration of duality, restraint, and the varying perspectives surrounding powerful women intertwines with the storylines of these popular cultural references, deepening the song's rich thematic tapestry. Through his lyrics, Drake invites listeners to appreciate and acknowledge the strength and ambition of those around them, ultimately inspiring us all to strive for greatness.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonylvsCknGilkaCybrnEZqerp6WZeqPFjJ2pmqOVYrqmrc2ipaBlkaOxbrjYq6Ccqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-and-thats-the-way-i-loved-you-oh-oh-oh-oh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of And that's the way I loved you, oh, oh, oh, oh</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gary-coleman-death-photo-being-shopped-shannon-price-trying-to-p.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gary Coleman Death Photos Sold; Shannon Price to Receive Cut of Profits</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
