My newborn baby photo from the hospital shows me with what can only be considered a full spike. In my teens and early 20s, I wasn’t quite yet well-versed in how to manage my thick mane, so I frequently had a mushroom or triangle-shaped bob. Thankfully, I’ve learned some secrets along the way to maintaining my tresses, due in small part to discovering the magic of a great, high-performing blow dryer and a flat iron. I also grew my hair out over the past couple years to what can only be considered mermaid length — it’s well past my chest and on its way to my waist — so I’ve put together an arsenal of hair products that keep my locks soft, nourished, and super healthy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are the five products that never leave my hair care routine — all on Amazon:<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-herbal-essences-smooth-shampoo-and-conditioner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Herbal Essences Smooth Shampoo and Conditioner</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter what other shampoos and conditioners I try — and, as a beauty writer, I’ve tested a lot — I always come back to this sweet-smelling duo for lush, smooth, and nourished locks. The Herbal Essences Smooth shampoo and conditioner duo has seen my strands through it all; I started using them back in high school, and was devastated when they were initially discontinued. Imagine my surprise and delight when the brand brought them back in 2013 (and, luckily, were kept in the line since). Since I only wash my hair once a week, I typically need shampoo twice, once focused just on the roots and a second all-over wash where I pile my hair on top of my head and really scrub it in. Then I condition, which is admittedly a bit of a process as I need quite a bit of product to fully detangle my thick tresses, and let it sit for about five minutes. I use three to four pumps of product for each step.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It may sound a bit intense, but it works. My almost waist-length hair is not only strong, smooth, and healthy, but stays fresh for days with no buildup or grease — I don’t even need dry shampoo. More than 9,000 Amazon shoppers agree, raving that the duo leaves their strands “shiny” and “voluminous.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $18 (Originally $21); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sexyhair-healthy-tri-wheat-leave-in-conditioner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>SexyHair Healthy Tri-Wheat Leave-In Conditioner</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My thick tresses easily knot and tangle, and it’s difficult to get a brush through them if I don’t really work to detangle it. So, even though I use conditioner, I always follow up with a leave-in detangler. This SexyHair leave-in conditioner is, hands down, the one I come back to time and again for its ability to remove every single snarl without weighing down my hair or leaving behind a greasy film. One bottle lasts me about four to five months, and I continually restock it in my routine. I liberally spray it from roots to ends, even flipping my hair over to make sure it coats every strand, and then comb the product through with my fingers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The product also has a number of other benefits; it tames frizz and flyaways, prevents split ends, helps with humidity resistance, and provides thermal protection up to 450-degrees Fahrenheit. The leave-in product has over 4,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, with shoppers saying it’s “fantastic on fine, oily, silver hair” and keeps hair “soft and manageable all day.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $16; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wet-brush-detangler-hair-brush></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wet Brush Detangler Hair Brush</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I own about six different kinds of hair brushes, so when I tell you that the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Wet Brush Detangler Brush</a> is the only one that consistently detangles my hair without tugging, I truly mean it. The brand’s patented flexible Intelliflex bristles help to remove knots without ripping through the hair, which means that not only is brushing my hair pain-free, but I notice a lot fewer strands pulling away from my head and sticking to the brush. The bristles never break or separate from the brush, so one brush has lasted me for years. I can brush my hair wet or dry with the same effect.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Available in over 50 different colors and patterns for under $10, the Wet Brush has a whopping 56,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, so I’m definitely not alone in my adoration. Reviewers agree that the bristles are “magical,” the brush doesn’t “grab hair and pull, and that it “gets through tangles faster and easier than other brushes.” (Fun fact: One shopper even successfully uses it to brush out <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">her long-haired cat</a>.) One thing’s for certain — my hair continues to be super happy whenever I use it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $9 (Originally $10); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ouai-hair-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ouai Hair Oil</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I was always wary of hair oil because I assumed it would weigh down my strands and make them look or feel greasy. And, to be fair, some hair oils I’ve tried in the past have done just that. But that’s not the case with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ouai’s Hair Oil</a>, which imparts a ton of shine without any residue or heaviness. It’s formulated with a mix of ama oil, which shields hair from humidity, borage oil for frizz reduction, baobab seed oil that works to hydrate and smooth, and African galanga root extract, which protects from color fading. I apply one pump of it directly after blow drying and flat ironing from roots to ends. My tresses are left looking super glossy, shiny, and frizz-free, and still feel super lightweight, which is honestly a dream come true. I also love the brand’s signature Rue St. Honoré scent, a mix of violet, gardenia, ylang-ylang, and white musk that’s heady and floral without being too overpowering.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Ouai oil is a hit with Amazon shoppers, too, who said they “literally have no frizz” after using it and that it adds “a lot of shine and softness.” It’s the finishing touch in my haircare routine, and definitely one of the reasons my thick tresses stay so manageable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $28; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5706GgnKNdna6qvoypqaicpZjBtHnEnaCtp6KoerG1wqSqZm5oZ4J5gZQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wendys-frosty-nutrition-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Wendy's Frosty Nutrition Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sweetgate-chipotle-chicken-burrito-bowl.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sweetgate renames its Chipotle Chicken Burrito Bowl over legal disputes with Chipotle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
