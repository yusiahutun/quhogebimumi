Arnot Robertson in 1935 after the fledgling star, then 26, gave the first of the famously intense performances that would become her hallmark, in a film called Dangerous.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And Davis enthusiastically embraced the idea that there was something of the night about her.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She would tell interviewers that not only was she born near Salem in Massachusetts — site of the notorious witch trials in the 17th century — but that she was actually descended from one of the women, Mary Bradbury, who was convicted of ‘Certaine Detestable arts’, including taking animal form and casting evil spells on ships.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She, herself, came into the world like a witch, Davis told a biographer, claiming: ‘A bolt of lightning hit a tree in front of the house the moment I was born.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was, everyone assumed, Hollywood hokum aimed at bolstering the star’s image as a fierce and unconventional screen icon who refused to conform.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Few took it seriously, least of all, one imagined, Bette Davis herself.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But that assumption is misplaced, according to astonishing new allegations from the star’s only natural child, Barbara Hyman.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As Mrs Hyman — known as ‘B.D’ or ‘Bede’ — told me this week, her manipulative and hard-drinking mother Bette did indeed believe she was a witch, and would cast spells on her enemies from her bed.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not only that, she claims she once saw her mother transform into an ‘evil, demonic presence’.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bede, now 70, is speaking out following publication of a book written by Davis’s former personal assistant in her later years that aims to rescue the star’s reputation — a reputation that has been repeatedly tarnished over the years by her estranged daughter.</p><img

and What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?, as eccentric and strong-willed but possessed of a ‘heart of gold’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The affectionate portrait by Sermak who became, in effect, the actress’s surrogate daughter and was left much of her fortune, is at odds with Bede’s devastating claim, which first emerged nearly 30 years ago, that her mother was a violent alcoholic who staged fake suicides to scare her children and encouraged her underage daughter to pursue a sex life.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Three decades after her mother’s death, Bede is still engaged in what must surely be the most prolonged mother-daughter feud in Hollywood history.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now running her own Christian mission from her Virginia home, Bede claims she and her family were among many victims of Davis’s black magic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She says her mother was so possessive that she couldn’t tolerate her marriage — aged just 16 — in 1963 to British

apparently placed a ‘demonic’ curse on their family that led to their older son developing bipolar disorder and Bede being diagnosed with ‘terminal’ cancer, which she miraculously survived.</p><p

Her own mother said she was evil from day one.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She loved evil and hated everything nice and kind and gentle. She did a great many people a great deal of harm.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bede insists a succession of Davis’s staff knew about her interest in black magic but, if not actively involved in assisting her, chose to keep quiet.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Interestingly, there is nothing about witchcraft in Bede’s 1985 memoir, My Mother’s Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She says now she has a Christian ministry, she wants to warn her flock about the occult.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It all sounds ridiculous unless you understand these things from a Christian standpoint,’ she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Indeed. In one of many video ‘testimonies’ she has released on YouTube for fellow Christians, Bede recounts how her mother ‘would sit on her bed’ and cast spells.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She had this big metal waste basket and she would have her secretary get a piece of clothing from someone who had vexed her, crossed her in her view,’ she claims.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She would take this piece of clothing and she would mumble incoherently and she would then set it on fire and hold it over this metal waste basket, and laugh as it burned and she dropped it into this container.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also recounted how her mother would buy fish whole so she could gut them, ripping their innards out as she mumbled the names of people she wished to do the same to.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although ‘people’s lives were destroyed’ and ‘all sorts of horrible things happened to them’, Bede says she didn’t understand it all until she became a Christian at 36.</p><img id=i-6e271e0585dcaf2c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/19/22/04C2CE870000044D-0-image-m-17_1508448755259.jpg height=400 width=306 alt="Bette Davis and third husband William Grant Sherry (artist, wrestler and boxer) (Now divorced) with their daughter Barbara Sherry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-99cdf32be8cea5c9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/10/19/23/000048C600000CB2-4998830-Mother_and_daughter_at_the_Savoy_in_London_in_1947-a-1_1508451935946.jpg height=400 width=306 alt="Mother and daughter at the Savoy in London in 1947" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Bette Davis and third husband William Grant Sherry (artist, wrestler and boxer) (Now divorced) with their daughter Barbara Sherry (left) and mother and daughter at the Savoy in London in 1947</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even more dramatically, she also relates how one night, at Davis’s Beverly Hills mansion in 1984, she watched her mother go through occult rituals in a ‘last-ditch attempt’ to make Bede ‘run back to her’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lying in bed, she says she suddenly felt tremendously scared.
