A small but growing group of charter boat operators are offering great white shark tours in a region where whale and seal-watching excursions have long been a tourist rite of passage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/07/cabe68ad-8a78-4d81-8dc7-28d36d350bc6_b1ceca83.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, a prominent non-profit research organisation, is among those that have jumped into the shark eco-tourism game. It’s also renovated its Shark Centre, a family-friendly museum showcasing its research into the local shark population, and is building another educational outpost, set to open next summer, in the bustling tourist centre of Provincetown.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Elsewhere, local shark-themed merchandisers are reporting brisk businesses, even as the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted parts of the region’s tourism industry. Cape Cod hosts about four million visitors a year, who bring in more than US$1 billion and support thousands of jobs.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Is this the world’s best place to swim with whale sharks?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It feels like we’re on the trajectory of it being a point of pride for Cape Cod,” says Patrick Clarke, owner of the jewellery company Cape Clasp, of the region’s white sharks. “A lot of the initial fear and hysteria was the fear of the unknown, but we’re learning more about them every year.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Clarke makes a range of jewellery featuring whales, turtles and other marine life, but says the shark-themed pieces – specifically a bracelet made from marine-grade cord held together by a sterling silver clasp shaped like a great white shark – are consistently his top sellers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Chatham, a hub of the local shark tourism industry, a company that started selling popular stickers of Cape Cod in the shape of a great white shark some seven years ago has taken off as the local shark population has also come into its own. Kristina Manter says Cape Shark, the apparel company she co-owns with her boyfriend, opened a bricks-and-mortar shop on Main Street last summer to sell a range of hoodies, sweatpants, T-shirts and other clothing adorned with the logo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/07/bd48e852-ef3c-4f81-b335-0ab407500318_c3e6d0ab.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re not just popping up because we saw the tourism. We’ve been around because we’ve loved the sharks and believed in their conservation,” Manter says. “It just kind of fell together perfectly.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There’s no definitive tally for how much shark-related tourism contributes to the roughly 105km peninsula’s economy, but its growth is helping stretch the tourist season into the autumn, as peak shark sightings happen in August and September, says Paul Niedzwiecki, CEO of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Indeed, dozens of beaches have temporarily closed in recent weeks after sharks were spotted as close as 10 metres from some of the Cape’s most famous stretches of sand. Shark researchers say they expect to be out tagging and observing the predators into November, if the weather permits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/07/3c3bb10e-816b-4ed1-b709-34ea23e43f53_b8c3e5a1.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Several years ago, there was a concern that it might have a negative impact on tourism,” Niedzwiecki says. “But we’ve been working to educate people about sharks and what we’ve actually seen is no negative impact.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mike Bosley, who captained the shark tour Simard and Antonoglou took last month, hopes shark watching tours can bring a different perspective to the local shark discourse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There’s always been sharks, but there hasn’t always been the opportunity to interact with sharks in this fashion,” says Bosley, whose Dragonfly Sportfishing started offering shark tours in earnest this summer, in between its regular fishing and whale-watching excursions. “They’re part of our ecosystem.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/07/a968e3f9-e421-45e7-9ec9-a7cef457bcd7_09d0a708.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the 2018 attacks, Cape officials have invested in training and equipment for lifeguards and first responders to keep beachgoers safe as great white sharks migrate in ever larger numbers to feast on the region’s bountiful seal population. But a group of concerned residents, holidaymakers and other advocates have formed a non-profit to push for more sophisticated and proactive shark safety measures, such as undersea detection, land-based warning systems and drone surveillance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Local surfers, meanwhile, have taken to arming themselves with shark repellents, including personal devices that emit electrical fields that supposedly deter but don’t harm sharks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Concern about great whites is growing elsewhere in New England, especially after a New York woman was fatally bitten by one in Maine last July, becoming the first person to die by shark attack in the state. Dozens of marine organisations and state agencies from Rhode Island to Canada formed a consortium to collaborate on shark research in response.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/07/1f637f32-ea5c-4c75-bf7b-f1d50e74b067_6114a0af.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Greg Skomal, a state marine biologist currently studying the hunting patterns of the Cape’s great whites, says shark tours could prove beneficial, so long as they continue to be done responsibly. There are currently no licensing or registration requirements for the tours, but those and other regulations should be considered if more join the fray, he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The state banned the use of bloody chum, decoys and other bait to lure sharks in 2015, meaning the kinds of shark cage diving operations that are common in Australia, South Africa and other shark-rich destinations aren’t allowed in Massachusetts waters, unless they’re more than 5km offshore, where state jurisdiction ends.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re very sensitive to activities that alter the sharks’ natural behaviour,” said Skomal. “We don’t want six (tours) following a single shark into shallow water near swimming beaches.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/07/dc5e1699-f1de-40dd-9165-860879306078_24c48547.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like most operations, Bosley’s Dragonfly Sportfishing generally stays hundreds of yards off shore, in water more than 2.4 metres deep. But it’s a relatively costly outing: the nearly three-hour tours, which rely on an overhead “spotter” plane to locate sharks, range anywhere from US$1,600 to US$2,500 per boat, and the vessels typically carry six passengers at most.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Antonoglou, a 47-year-old civil engineer, said the experience was worth the expense.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When people think of great whites, they think of Jaws, but it’s not like that at all,” she said. “It’s pretty cool that we know they’re out there. The populations are thriving, and I think it’s a great asset for the Cape.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmprcHBmbXy0tMCromasn6q%2Fqr%2FMZpqaqJVisLCwjKucnKemmr%2B0eZFpaHFllpbBoriMmqutmZOgerW71Kuq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-enough-cast-where-are-they-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Enough Cast: Where Are They Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./neighbours-spoilers-zoe-cramond-amy-16849160.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Neighbours takes sick turn as Amy Williams has sex amid incest fears</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
