The style has found a number of fans among K-pop stars as well as international celebrities such as Wiz Khalifa, Rita Ora, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rihanna, who have now become long-term clients.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to the Seoul fashion scene, streetwear is king.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With rebellion messages monogrammed in white block letters and jackets with curling varsity scripts, labels such as Cres E Dim, Kye, Rocket X Lunch and Charm’s are shaping the modern Korean’s style sensibilities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With an explosion of colour, modern techniques, craft and use of experimental fabrics, their collections can be seen as a reconstruction of fresh millennial ideals. “Korean millennials are experiencing an entirely different world to their parents. The technological and internet progression has given young Koreans a fresh platform to communicate with the world, and therefore the post-digital Korean style can sometimes seem detached from the traditional aesthetic,” says London-based independent exhibition curator and creative lead at the Hyman Archive, Tory Turk, who specialises in style and popular culture and has curated exhibitions for the Korean Culture Centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Korean streetwear today is a far cry from the traditional styles of the 1900s, and is documenting a massive cultural shift. It represents breaking away from outdated notions where a lot of emphasis is placed on ideas of prosperity, luck and longevity. It’s all about free expression and individualism now.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brands use these experimental ideas as a selling point, which generates a sense of relevance. “I think it is about youth culture’s obsession with desiring to be both unique and ubiquitous and [monograms or logos] are streetwear codes that satisfy this paradox,” Turk says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, a huge part of this sense of uniqueness is inspired by American and European cultures. It is common for local designers to often rely on copies of high- end international brands and discounts to sell their designs. The upside of this is its obvious global appeal but chasing individuality sometimes comes at the cost of losing authenticity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I design, I concentrate most on how distinctive, unusual and extraordinary the clothes are. Originality isn’t as important. It’s street culture. The inspiration can come from anywhere,” admits Woo Jin-won, creative director at Rocket X Lunch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think that this graphic and photogenic logo/text mania is in fact an international phenomenon, or at least a Western one,” adds Sofia Hedman, curator and exhibition designer who guest-curated the Korean International Fashion Showcase, “A New Space Around the Body” for the British Council.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The borrowed cultural elements are obviously what appeal to a global audience. But what makes Korean streetwear so exceptional and remarkable?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A sense of humour is an important aspect. Subversive messages or salty remarks on bags and shirts meant to mock pop culture are extremely popular. Take Kanei Tei who uses used military tents to create designer bags, “We try to tell people about peace and at the same time, its ever increasing love affair with violence. It’s almost satirical,” explains founder and designer Chung Kwan-young.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For their spring 2017 collection, “Exposure”, the designer used the colour khaki (commonly used as camouflage) to symbolise how the military “camouflages” its coercive culture and violent weapons of destruction as attempts to attain peace. “We used disassembled pieces of military tents painted with distinct colours and collaged them into bags. Tents without their camouflaging function symbolise peace, while irregularly cut and freely painted tent pieces suggest the intimidating tactics,” Chung says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beyond all the irony, exaggerated silhouettes and bold messages, however, is an understated and calm design aesthetic that brands identify with.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The idea is to be unpretentious and prove style can be achieved without any unnecessary elements. Details such as little pops of colour and mismatched fabric and colour patches keep this simplicity fresh. “I believe Korean fashion has developed a magic mix of beautiful minimalism, impeccable tailoring and an incredible experimental spirit, which sometimes quite literally turns our perceptions upside down,” Hedman says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This blend of strong individual convictions and traditional aesthetics is what resonates with an entire generation that extends beyond the borders of this tiny Asian peninsula. Hedman believes it’s what makes Korean streetwear such a large-scale phenomenon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We live in a global world today, where global trends sometimes appear to erase national boarders, and at the best, create solidarity.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This article was originally published in Destination Macau</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZp%2BZo522sLqMm5yaraSufKK%2B06KapZ1fZ316gJdqbGijn6eyorqMrKurnZWpxKat0WarmqOVqHqnrdKhoKimXaiwprrEZqqtp6Ki</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./victor-bolden-jr-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Victor Bolden Jr. Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-pardi-nude-maternity-shoot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Pardi's Wife Shares an Ethereal Nude Maternity Shot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
