He needs to take responsibility,’ she said. “He can say whatever he likes, of course, and I understand he has an image to preserve, but he is portraying himself as the victim and he’s making me look like a liar, like I’ve made up these stories.” She continued: “He is indirectly suggesting that I’m the one who has made Victoria suffer.”</p><p>In response to the sensational gossip surrounding their supposed relationship, Loos said: “Yes, the stories were horrible, but they’re true. He talks in the documentary about this ultimately being his private life, shutting it down. I think it’s one thing to keep your private life to yourself. It’s another thing to mislead the public. And so many people had forgotten about all of this. So many people put all this behind them, this whole affair, the scandal and everything. And he’s dragged it back up again in a way that is affecting my reputation.”</p><p>She continued: “I think if he was going to touch on this time and how difficult it was, it would have been really nice for him to have said ‘it was not my proudest time’. The worse bit for me is that he says he didn’t like seeing his wife suffer. That bothered me. Because he’s the one that’s caused the suffering. He could have simply said that this was a tough time and I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p>Loos concluded: “If you don’t want to take responsibility for things because of your family and your children that’s absolutely fine. And if he had just said it was a tough time for us and moved on I wouldn’t be here today. But he specifically made it look like… my fault, that he had nothing to do with this.”</p><p>After the Netflix documentary aired, she faced “disgusting” comments against her on an Instagram post of her in a yoga position, to which she replied: “Thank you 🙏🏼 am taking in the nasty comments with as much humour as I can ❤️.” Mostly, though, there were messages of support.</p><p>One fan questioned: “Why is the other woman always subjected to such hate? Why not the married man? Bet there’s no nasty comments on his Insta page!” Another wrote: “The amount of hate this poor lady is receiving is shocking. Most of them mothers, some of them are shouting about mental health in their bios. To bring another woman down and troll her says much more about you!” A third commented: “She’s been living a quiet and what appears to be a very content life,” a third commented. “To be dragged into this again is sad.”</p><p>Posh and Becks, as they have often been known as, have always denied he actually had an affair and in the documentary series, the alleged woman is never named, though his assistant Rebecca Loos claimed they’d “connected” on a night out with friends in 2004. “I would always say to myself, ‘Don’t risk your job’ and I knew there was a huge risk involved if I got involved with this man,” she told Sky News at the time, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Mirror</a>. “I really hope that they get through it. I think the problems were in their marriage long before I came into the picture.”</p><p>In response, David issued a statement denying the affair. “During the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life. What appeared this morning is just one further example. The simple truth is that I am very happily married. I have a wonderful wife and two very special kids. There is nothing any third party can do to change these facts.”</p><p>In&nbsp;Beckham, Victoria finally broke her silence on these rumors. “You know, up until Madrid, sometimes it felt like us against everybody else but we were together, we were connected, we had each other,” she said. “But when we were in Spain, it didn’t really feel like we had each other either. And that’s sad. I can’t even begin to tell you how hard it was and how it affected me. It was a nightmare. It was an absolute circus — and everyone loves it when the circus comes to town, right? Unless you’re in it.”</p><p>When asked if she resented her husband at the time, Victoria answered in the affirmative. “If I’m being totally honest, yes, I did,” she admitted. “It was the most unhappy I have ever been in my entire life. It wasn’t that I felt unheard because I was always mindful of the focus that he needed.”</p><p>Echoing his sentiments from the statement he issued at the time, David admitted: “There was some horrible stories which were difficult to deal with. It was the first time that me and Victoria had been put under that kind of pressure in our marriage.”</p><p>When asked how their marriage survived this barrage of controversy, David explained, “Every time that we woke up we felt, you know, there was something else and, you know, we felt that, we both felt at the time that we were not losing each other but drowning.</p><p>“But ultimately, it’s our private life,” he added. “There were some days I thought, ‘How am I going to go to work? How am I going to go on that training pitch and look as if nothing is wrong?’ I felt physically sick every day when I opened my eyes. How am I going to do this?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfp7KjscKcmGakn6TAbrDAr6CdZZKasKy0wKZkmp6Wlrazew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./breakthrough-prize-ceremony-fashion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 2024 Breakthrough Prize Ceremony: The 10 best dressed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-carradine-and-annie-bierman.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Carradine and Annie Bierman</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
