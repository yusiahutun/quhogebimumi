"I'm so proud of her, love her to death, and I don't know, I just feel like sometimes I don't really have anything for myself."</p><p>The "Zoey 101" alum shared more thoughts in a confessional, saying, "I can be extremely proud for my sister, but also have my own identity and be expected to seen as my own person."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:766ae1eb-c1b9-4c1c-bfde-5b5556be6e1f data-container-ref=toofab:article:49b06ec7-7e09-4072-ba33-27bd90a5a5a0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/5by4/2022/12/16/7120cae28b194b58a7d839baeebe23a0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Sam Asghari Would Prefer Britney Spears Didn't Post Naked Photos, But Defends Her from Backlash</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I struggle with self-esteem all the time, and as a parent you really want to fake it because you don't want to ever see your children feel the feelings you feel," added Jamie Lynn, who is mom to daughters Maddie, 14, and Ivey, 4.</p><p>Last January, the release of Jamie Lynn's memoir, "Things I Should Have Said," sparked major drama between her and Britney. As the<a href=#> former promoted the memoir</a>, she and Britney went gone back at forth at each other over claims Jamie Lynn makes in the book, as well as in <a href=#>interviews like "Nightline" promoting it.</a></p><p>Eventually, Britney said she does love her sister "unconditionally" and added that it's "so tacky for a family to fight publicly like this" -- while asking her sister to show her some loyalty, instead of showing it to "the people that hurt me the most" amid her conservatorship battle. Jamie Lynn responded asking for her sister to call her so they could settle it offline.</p><p>"I'm happy to share how many times I've reached out to you, supported you and tried to help you. This is embarrassing and has to stop. I love you," she added.</p><p>The series airs Wednesdays at 8 pm ET on Fox.</p><a id=gallery-link-90bf828d-2a13-4239-af23-d1cb51a1c8b6 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:90bf828d-2a13-4239-af23-d1cb51a1c8b6 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:49b06ec7-7e09-4072-ba33-27bd90a5a5a0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/30/4by3/2022/07/21/30725ac3aa274c24ac5b05195dc68fb7_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmaW1fn66utcRmo7KmnmLAsbHAq6pmmqKewa%2Bx2GaqqZ2Rp8Buv8SlnWado6myprmMrKeem5mWuW6yzquanqtf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./supreme-team.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Supreme Team - Showtime - Watch on Paramount Plus</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chanda-rubin-married-wedding-husband-boyfriend-family-net-worth-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chanda Rubin Married, Wedding, Husband, Boyfriend, Family, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
