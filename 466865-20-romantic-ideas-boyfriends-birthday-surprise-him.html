Most people love surprise parties if not for the surprise itself, for the effort to make it happen. The good thing with parties is that you can do a wide range of different things.</p><p class=align-left>Normally, a birthday party is attended by friends who come to support one of their own. However, if yours is a relationship in which weird is the new normal, then you can change that. You can invite strangers to the birthday party, and your boyfriend will still love the gesture.</p><h3>3.

A camping trip</h3><p class=align-left>Everybody loves camping, and that's why you can never go wrong with this birthday idea for your boyfriend. So pack the bags and take him out for a camping trip in the woods, where it is just the two of you. But, of course, if you intend to have more exciting activities, you can let a few of your friends tag along.</p><p class=align-left>Camping can be a one-night activity or even for several nights. Since you will be away from your normal routines, this will give you the perfect opportunity to bond more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/93ee490ae1bf2bea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best happy birthday songs</span></p></a><h3>5.

Renting that fancy car for a day might still be expensive, but it will be worth it. The car will make him giggle like a child, and you will love every bit of the experience.</p><p class=align-left>With the fancy car, you can incorporate other activities for your boyfriend's birthday, such as a bucket list of the crazy things you have always dreamt of doing together. The car is something you will hear him talk about for a long time.</p><h3>6. Symbolic present</h3><p class=align-left>A symbolic gift is something to be treasured for a lifetime and does not have to be expensive. It can be a blood vial necklace that will serve as a symbol of your undying love. It can also be a lucky charm he will carry wherever he goes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e5988006ed8500a3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>2018 Netflix movies you must re-watch</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can also shop for a symbolic present that matches his personality.

Tickets to their favourite team's game</h3><p class=align-left>Sports is like a cup of tea for men, which is why you should get hold of tickets to his<a href=#> favourite team's</a> game even if you can't stand it. You can also use the opportunity to have a birthday message displayed for him on the big screen.</p><p class=align-left>If you can't attend <a href=#>the game</a> because you are not a fan or committed, you can still give him the tickets to go with his friends. This will allow you to plan other surprises for later when he comes home.</p><h3>8. Collage of special pictures</h3><p class=align-left>You take pictures to capture your great moments for future reference. There is no better time to go on a trip down memory lane than during your boyfriend's birthday. Remind him of all the good times you have had with a collage of your most special pictures.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fdd04fbca4402a1d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ funny African proverbs with meanings (they'll get you thinking)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This can be a special gift when you creatively arrange the pictures. You can also write a short story to accompany the pictures and make it a picture book. Another option is to have your best pictures framed and hung on the wall.</p><h3>9. Spending the day at a winery</h3><p class=align-left>If you are dating a wine fanatic, the best birthday plan for your boyfriend is a trip to a winery. While seeing the wine-making process is thrilling, your boyfriend will be happy to know he can taste <a href=#>different wines</a> without paying a penny.</p><p class=align-left>Wine plays a vital role in the romance of a couple, and this trip can be used to serve as a special moment. Order the rarest wine available to be taken only during special occasions.</p><h3>10. Go to an escape room</h3><p class=align-left>Have fun in an escape room as you undertake challenging tasks and discover how good you are as a team. It will also give the relationship competitiveness that will help the two of you grow as a couple because you will want to improve the other person.</p><p class=align-left>This is a good idea for the boyfriend, that loves puzzles and shows how creative he is. This is not just an excuse to spend time together because you will also be meeting new people and experiencing new things.</p><h3>11. A trip to the amusement park</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b6a9c4ebf2550e6.jpg><p class=align-left>There is no such thing as an adult in an amusement park. The <a href=#>amusement park</a> will bring out the inner child of your boyfriend, and it will reveal a side of him you have never seen before. Riding roller coasters together is one way to spend the birthday.</p><p class=align-left>If he insists that he is too grown for the activities, the trip can act as a charity event. Bring gifts to give to less fortunate children. He will be more than happy to show compassion to those who need it most.</p><h3>12. Cool gadgets</h3><p class=align-left>Men have an obsession with electronic gadgets. Gifting them these gadgets is one way of leaving a lasting impression in their minds. In addition, new inventions can be a good starting point because they give them something to boast about around their friends.</p><p class=align-left>One of the best ideas of gadgets to get your boyfriend is a videogame. But, of course, it can also be something like a computer or a smartwatch. Whatever it is you will buy for him, be sure that he will treasure it for a very long time.</p><h3>13. Custom rings</h3><p class=align-left>There are many amazing ideas relating to rings. The most classic one is having matching rings to mark an important occasion such as a birthday or an anniversary. However, consider customising them if you want to give the rings an extra touch.</p><p class=align-left>One way to do this is to engrave GPS coordinates of your favourite spot or the place where you first met them. It can also be a quote he treasures or even a<a href=#> Bible verse</a> that means a lot to you.</p><h3>14. Magical basket</h3><p class=align-left>Magical basket ideas work best when you can't decide what you want to buy your boyfriend on his birthday. It is not possible for him not to be impressed by a basket filled with many different small things.</p><p class=align-left>These can be a novel, a pair of socks, chocolate, a photo album, <a href=#>football game </a>tickets, and a romantic movie CD. Pick as many things as the basket can hold; even though they may not be costly, the gesture will be priceless.</p><h3>15. Paintball with friends</h3><p class=align-left>Paintball is the perfect activity for you to hunt down your boyfriend and capture his heart once again. Initially, it may sound like a childish idea, but once the game starts, you will know how much it means to him and his friends.</p><p class=align-left>Paintball allows you to kill many birds with one stone. First, the game will increase the bond with your friends because it will be one more activity you undertake together. In addition, it is also a form of exercise because it is a physical activity.</p><h3>16. Write him a card</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f3f8cb4899b28702.jpg><p class=align-left>Birthday cards are a tradition which is seen as a romantic gesture. Go out of the way to create a card yourself instead of buying ready-made. Customize it with a poem or a text you know he will like.</p><p class=align-left>The card can also provide clues about other surprises you have in store for the <a href=#>birthday celebration</a>. Transform it into a treasure hunt that will end with him finding the most expensive present. Of course, this can also be you dressing in a s*xy way and hiding for him to find you.</p><h3>17. Candlelit dinner</h3><p class=align-left>There is nothing more romantic than a candlelit dinner for two. This can either be in a dim restaurant section or even at home. This is a low-key way of celebrating a birthday by eating your favourite dish and having a nice chat.</p><p class=align-left>To make it more memorable, you can send him a flower bouquet, birthday card and new clothes for the date night in advance. If it is a late-night dinner, you can also book a room reservation where he will get five-star treatment.</p><h3>18. Birthday countdown mails</h3><p class=align-left>Show him how excited you are about his upcoming birthday with frequent emails counting down to the big day. You can start this activity one week, two weeks or even a month before your birthday. The frequency of the emails can increase as the day approaches.</p><p class=align-left>The content of these emails can be about how much you care for him and the things you are ready to do to make him happy. The idea is to make him feel special for as long as possible.</p><h3>19. Create a short film for him</h3><p class=align-left>You probably have many videos of the two of you from when you became a couple. Use those videos to create a short film to celebrate your time together.</p><p class=align-left>Such a video is a precious gift because it requires time to create. So look for even those clips from his childhood and incorporate them into the video.</p><h3>20. Be the surprise</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>ultimate gift</a> your boyfriend can have for his birthday is you. Be extra nice to him when he wakes up from bed to nightfall. Apart from the normal treats, you can go out of your way to give him some adventure.</p><p class=align-left>Start with adorning a pretty dress and putting on a sweet perfume. Then, sneak him at his workplace and surprise him with a <a href=#>happy birthday</a> song with his colleagues.</p><h3>Frequently asked questions</h3><li>How can I make my boyfriend's birthday romantic?
