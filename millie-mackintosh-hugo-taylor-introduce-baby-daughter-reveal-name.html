"We've been on cloud nine; it's gone so quickly. We've been in our little love bubble at home, cherishing those newborn moments, whether that's her sleeping on me or just lapping up all the cuteness." Hugo adds: <strong>"Sienna has turned our world upside down.

Millie, 30, felt "really calm" at the prospect of the birth, she says: "We were supported by such incredible nurses, doctors and midwives throughout the whole process."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d047acb9ea07-sienna-necklace-z.jpg><p id=ep2zA5rzmveL data-wc=4><strong>Connect name&nbsp;necklace, £160, <span><a aria-label="name necklace" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">Aurum + Grey</a></span></strong></p><h6><span><a aria-label="name necklace" class=hm-link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored">BUY NOW</a></span></h6><p id=e2vqY9dRBdNO data-wc=84>And she was delighted when Hugo was authorized to be present at the birth, amid Covid-19 protocols. "I felt really lucky to have him there holding my hand for that special moment. It was incredible," she says. <strong>"When I first saw her, I cried. I remember thinking: 'Oh my God, this is really real.'</strong> Even though you've been carrying a baby for nine months, you still can't quite believe it until you meet her. I definitely felt a surge of love in that moment."</p><p id=eK6YPitlhqS8 data-wc=82>Now Millie can't wait to start planning playdates with family and friends; not least <a class=hm-link href=#>Vogue Williams</a>, whose baby girl is due this summer and whose husband Spencer Matthews co-starred with Millie and Hugo on the Bafta-winning Made in Chelsea. "It'll be so cute for them to play together," she says. "I'm delighted Vogue's having a girl – I know she really wanted a girl. For ages we were like: 'We've got to get pregnant at the same time,' and then we actually did."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ae1417f712f9-millie-mackintosh-family-z.jpg><p id=ex0QULtcCKbR data-wc=11><strong>The couple pose with Sienna for their first Instagram family photo</strong></p><p id=eZ4XJR4WIh7U data-wc=83>Millie and Hugo shared the arrival of their first child last month, exclusively telling <strong>HELLO! </strong>magazine: "We are delighted to announce the arrival of our darling girl who arrived on Friday 1 May at 1:21pm, weighing a very healthy seven pounds. We are eternally grateful to the doctors, nurses and midwives for taking such good care of us. Mum and baby are both doing incredibly well and we are looking forward to bringing our daughter home and spending time together as a family."</p><p id=eC70RAcL2vqV data-wc=72><strong>The doting new parents also shared their pregnancy announcement exclusively in HELLO! in November, confirming that they were expecting a girl.</strong> "Hearing her heartbeat for the first time with Hugo by my side was one of the most amazing moments of my life so far," said Millie. "I feel very lucky. I can't wait to feel that bond and for her to sleep on my chest and breathe in that baby smell."</p><p id=eE5mtRoRpCny data-wc=60>After seeing an exciting first glimpse of their daughter during a scan, Millie added:<strong> "She's got long legs - Hugo thinks she's going to be really tall like him. I'm so excited it's a girl. </strong>I would've been delighted with either, but when I found out we were having a girl, I suddenly realised this is what I really wanted."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/08981bd098a2-millie-mackintosh-wedding-z.jpg><p id=eD-NW9n9vand data-wc=6><strong>The couple&nbsp;married in June 2018</strong></p><p id=eUBcqhBunxGi data-wc=111>The couple married in June 2018, in a romantic ceremony at Whithurst Park in West Sussex, which was covered exclusively by <strong>HELLO!</strong>. The ceremony included thoughtful touches to create a wedding day that fully reflected them and their relationship. As guests entered a stunning marquee for the sit-down meal they were greeted by long wooden tables that were named after the nightclubs the couple frequented, with the bride and groom taking their seats at the Boujis table – a sweet nod to where they first met 12 years ago. And the marquee itself was styled to perfection, with pink and red peonies, gold-accented glassware, napkin rings and plates adorning the tables.</p><p id=eCCjpeevv5wy data-wc=76>Hugo and Millie were first friends before dating in 2011 while appearing on Made in Chelsea. But they split up before reconciling in 2016. "I knew she was The One within about five minutes of us getting back together," Hugo explained, while Millie added: "But if we'd stayed together when we were younger, we wouldn't&nbsp;be together now. We had to go away, do our separate things and grow as people. We needed that time apart."</p><p id=eDdxlmCPrpZf data-wc=14><strong>Pick up the new issue of HELLO! out on Monday for the full interview.</strong></p><p id=eKWJ_2Z1-NhW data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnxzfJFpZ29oZ22GdX%2BTaKSipJyesm65wJyioqakpMCpeceunqhlpJbGrbvRZqCnrKKksbavxGaZmpqpYrGiwcahq56qXaeyt7HApWSnmZ2afA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./naked-ambition-wimbledon-s-golden-girl-agnieska-radwanska-s-feud-tennis-coach-dad-risqu-photo-shoot-left-fuming-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wimbledon 2016 star Agnieszka Radwanska's naked photo shoot revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-george-clooney-amal-twins-ella-and-alexander.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet George and Amal Clooney's twins Ella and Alexander: all we know</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
