However, the singer admitted in an episode of the group’s <a href=#>reality TV</a> show BTS in the Soop 2 that the rescue dog was getting old and could no longer see. Then, in early 2022, he posted on Instagram about his three other pups: Bam, Song, and Paeng. Bam is a Doberman Pinscher, and Song and Paeng are Italian greyhounds, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hindustan Times</a> reports.</p><p id=par-4_43>As for J-Hope, he has a Shih Tzu named Mickey. But the rapper revealed in the same BTS in the Soop 2 episode that his dog, like Jungkook’s Gureum, is aging and hard of hearing.
