On contrary, who have secure attachment styles could have better ability to understand the difficulties of casual relationships and conserve positive experiences.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Could this lead to a serious relationship?</h4><p>Yes, causal relationship could contribute to the more serious one committed relationships. But this requires the careful consideration as well as communication from both the sides.
