"She knew I had a crush on him.”</p><p>The&nbsp;crush between the country hitmakers began earlier this year, while both participated in the CRS New Faces of Country Music Show in Nashville. After Pearce shared some hints on Instagram that <a href=#>she had her eyes on Ray </a>(she "slid into his DMs"), the "<a href=#>Hide the Wine</a>"&nbsp;singer decided to invite him via text to her No. 1 party for "<a href=#>Every Little Thing</a>."</p><p>"It took me a few days to press send," Pearce admits with a laugh. "It was one of those things that once I put it out there, I couldn’t go back."</p><p><strong>Carly Pearce Spills All on Dating Michael Ray</strong></p><p>Ray did end up attending the event, which Pearce&nbsp;says "was a very good sign." But&nbsp;next thing she knew, her mom was walking toward him.</p><p>“She went up to him and said, ‘Hi Michael,’”&nbsp;the singer&nbsp;recalls,&nbsp;“She tells him that, ‘My daughter would kill me if she knew I was talking to you.' My dad even told me to date him. My family definitely gave him the stamp of approval that night."</p><p>Since officially&nbsp;revealing their relationship in July of this year, Pearce says that she feels that meeting and dating Ray came at just the right time.</p><p>“I know that at 30 years old, I had kept my personal life pretty private,” she shares. “I used to wonder why some of my past relationships didn’t work out. They just weren’t my person. (Ray) came into my life very much right on time.”</p><p>Both Pearce's personal and professional lives are in a good place. This week, she shared on her social media channels that she has started working on new music:</p><p>“Jon just ran by my tour bus,” laughs Pearce during&nbsp;our phone interview. “But yep, I’m having a blast. (Luke) is the sweetest person. He is so kind. It’s still unbelievable that I am out on the road with him."</p><p><strong>See Country Music's Best Love Stories:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGTna6muIyrmLJlk5a%2FrcWMqZyaqpOaerGt0Z6lratdlr2xvs6vmKVn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./does-rumored-gay-actor-ryan-carnes-have-any-plans-to-get-married-has-a-girlfriend-in-past-to-falsify-the-speculations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Does Rumored Gay Actor Ryan Carnes Dating Someone?
