"People had forgotten how great she was. They let all the personal things about her life outweigh why they fell in love with her in the first place."</p><p>She also shot down the "popular misconception" that Whitney was broke at the time of her death: "She had money when she died," Pat said. "It wasn't multimillions, like everyone thought, but she wasn't broke."</p><p>One of the most awarded and best selling female artists of all time, Whitney sold more than 200million records and won seven of her 25 Grammy nominations.
