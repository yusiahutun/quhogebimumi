The <a href=#>music</a> star explained, one took a particular interest and tried to bite her. She penned her brother “literally saved my life” as she was “paralyzed by fear” during the encounter, though she did theorize why the animal went after her.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-489548980-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-sea-lion-tried-to-attack-shakira>A sea lion tried to attack Shakira</h2><p>In 2012, Shakira was vacationing with family and had gone on an “adventurous trip” to see some wildlife when she was attacked by a sea lion, but things didn’t go to plan.</p><p>In a post titled Special Report: Attacked by a Sea Lion, the now 46-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> “everyone screamed, including me” when the sea lion launched its almost successful attack on her.</p><p>“This afternoon I happened to see some sea lions and seals. I thought to myself how cute they were so I decided to get a bit closer than all of the other tourists and went down to a rock trying to pet them doing a baby talk while taking pictures…</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Robin Williams would still be ‘alive if Christopher Reeve was still around’, film star says</a></p><p>“Suddenly, one of them jumped out of the water so fast and impetuously that it got about one foot away from me, looked me in the eye, roared in fury, and tried to bite me. Everyone there screamed, including me,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> penned.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-brother-saved-her-life>Her brother ‘saved her life’</h2><p>She then praised her brother, whom she called “Super Tony” for “literally saving” her life</p><p>Sharkia continued at the time: “I was paralyzed by fear and couldn’t move, I just kept eye contact with it while my brother “Super Tony” jumped over me and literally saved my life, taking me away from the beast. We both got our hands and legs scratched by the rocks while trying to protect ourselves.”</p><p>The Colombian superstar told fans she thought it was actually her Blackberry phone that caused her disastrous encounter with the sea lion.</p><p>“I believe what happened is that it confused the shiny reflection of the blackberry I was taking these pics with, with some sort of fish,” she added.</p><p>“It probably thought I was teasing it with food and then taking it away from it. Wow! It’s funny that only half an hour before I was complaining to my guide Andrew that I never get to see wild animals up close on adventurous trips.”</p><p>“Oh well, I can’t say that anymore!! Now I’m off to see some penguins! I hope they are a bit more friendly!” she quipped.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-was-not-the-first-time-she-was-attacked-by-an-animal>This was not the first time she was attacked by an animal</h2><p>Nearly a decade after the sea lion attack, Shakira was assaulted by not one, but two, wild boars. This time, she was with her son Milan, now 11. It took place in 2021 while the mom-son duo were out at a park in Barcelona.</p><p>On her <a href=#>Instagram</a> Story, she showed followers her near-wrecked bag and said: “Look at how two wild boars which attacked me in the park have left my bag. They were taking my bag to the woods with my mobile phone in it.”</p><p>She continued: “They’ve destroyed everything,” before turning to her son and saying: “Milan tell the truth. Say how your mummy stood up to the wild boar.”</p><p>Later, in an interview with Glamour, the Hips Don’t Lie hitmaker said people were around but didn’t help and were “just watching.” She called the incident “crazy.”</p><p>“We were just minding our own business,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “And then two huge wild boars came from the back and ambushed [us] and took my purse!”</p><p>“And I was like, “Oh, my God! Oh, my God!” and screaming, because they were taking it away, with my phone in it, my car keys, everything! Like they could understand me! And people were just watching and they weren’t doing anything!” she says, laughing over the incident afterward, in which luckily no one was hurt.</p><p>“They started digging inside my purse… Obviously, my son’s sandwich was inside the purse, so that’s why they were so interested. So they took the sandwich and walked away and left my purse. It was wild.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Will Poulter truly believes it’s ‘weird’ people are so obsessed with his eyebrows</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2V%2FcL%2FHmqKiqpFixKK%2FjKmYq5mcrsemsIybsGaelZa%2FbsPHnqVmmqKkwamx0Waqmq6VmXqpsdFmo6KelWK2r3nSnphmpJmku26t062YnKNf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./floyd-mayweather-johnny-dang-huge-chain-one-million-dollars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Floyd Mayweather Drops $1 Mil On Huge 5+ Lb.
