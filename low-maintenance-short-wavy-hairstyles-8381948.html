To do so, celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>David Lopez</a> says to start with freshly washed and towel-dried hair (we recommend using an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Aquis Flip Hair-Drying Tool</a>, $50, as the microfiber material is less likely to snag strands and trigger frizz). Once mostly dry, he says to apply a curl-enhancing mousse (such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Rizos Curls Curl Defining Mousse</a>, $22). “Use your fingers to scrunch and tousle your hair while blow-drying on a low heat and speed setting,” he instructs. “Finish by using a small curling wand to add definition to specific sections if desired.” (Need a slim curling wand?

To get the look, she says to start with damp hair, detangler, and curl cream—unless you have naturally curly hair, in which case just let it air dry. After prepping and drying your hair, she says to use a .5” curling wand to add more texture to your wavy hair or to define your pre-existing curls. “Wrap small sections of hair tightly around the wand and hold for three to five seconds,” she instructs. “Release the curl, and let it cool.” Her pro tip? Touch your curls as little as possible. “The more you touch the curls, the more frizz and the more likely they are to fall,” she warns.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After curling your hair or touching up your natural texture, Gabi says to pull your hair into a loose mid-height pony (leaving a few face-framing tendrils out) and twist it upwards. “Use an elastic with two bobby pins, like a bungee, to secure the at the top of the head,” she instructs. (Alternatively, you can use the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kitsch Hair Bungee Elastics</a>, $6.) “From here, you can fluff your curls and pin to make sure they’re sitting how you like them.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bob-with-beachy-waves></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bob With Beachy Waves</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Albert L.

To recreate the look, he says to start with damp hair. “Apply a curl-enhancing product and diffuse,” he instructs. “Then, use a large-barrel curling iron or wand to wrap sections of your hair around the barrel, holding for a few seconds.” When doing so, he says to alternate the direction of the curls throughout your hair for a more natural and dimensional end look. “Once all sections are curled, run your fingers through the waves to break them up and create soft, textured layers.” When your waves look as you’d like, lock them in place with a flexible hairspray, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bumble and bumble Spray de Mode Flexible Hold Hairspray</a> ($36).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wavy-center-part-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wavy Center-Part Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Mike Marsland/ Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alexa Chung's semi-shiny wavy bob looks like an air-dried masterpiece.

Gabi recommends recreating her glamorous side-parted waves. To achieve Lily’s glamorous waves, she says to begin with damp hair and prep with a cocktail of detangler, volumizing spray, and root-boosting mousse. “Focus the volume spray section by section at the roots for added volume,” she instructs. “The mousse should be layered from roots to ends.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After your hair is prepped, she says to blow dry strands upside down to enhance volume. Once dry, she says to lightly mist hair with hairspray before curling in large sections with a 1.5-2-inch curling iron. “You’ll want to hold the iron vertical to your face and start in the middle of each section,” she says. “Continue this around the head until all of your hair is curled.” Then, to create Lily’s polished, shiny texture, Gabi says to smooth a pump or two of shine oil through your mids and ends. “Your ends can always handle a bit more product than the rest of your hair,” she exclaims. For even more smoothing action, she says to spray a paddle brush with flexible-hold hairspray and comb through each section to manage unruly flyaways while enhancing staying power.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wolf-cut></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wolf Cut</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Nina Westervelt/ Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s another Ciara look that celebrity stylists recommend. “This is one of my favorite looks at the moment,” Gabi admits. “You can enhance a natural wave or you can mimic it.” To do so, she says to prep hair with detangler and blowout cream from roots to ends. “For the bangs, you’ll want to blow dry first from side to side—this will give you plenty of movement; then you’ll want to part your hair and gently roll the bangs towards the center of your part out, think ‘C’ motions with your brush,” she says. Once dry, she says to pinch your bangs at the part and spray with high-hold hairspray to maintain the lift.
