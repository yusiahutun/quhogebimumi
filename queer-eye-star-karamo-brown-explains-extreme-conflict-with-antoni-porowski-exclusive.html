While his discussion of the misunderstanding contained the phrase "extreme conflict" with essentially no further information on what went down, he told us it's all been "blown out of proportion." (You can read all about that podcast <a href=#><strong>here</strong></a> or in the link above.)</p><p>"There was no fighting or cussing or anything," he recalled. "There was none of that. You know what I mean? We're not even those type of people, those aren't even our personalities. It was just somebody in a third party got involved. And this happens in every work environment, in families where you let that third party sort of influence what you think is going on when it's not the truth. And when you have everyone in your ear or you start being like, 'Oh my gosh, like this person said that?' when you never even heard the person say that. And that's what happened with us."</p><p>"The reason we talked about it was because we were strangers when we first started [the show]," he continued. "We didn't know each other, just like what happens when you go to school for the first day or when you go to a new job."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e3c7c106-5f2a-5237-aca2-c17d8d06c1b5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:719b07ac-813f-5b85-b961-4d37abddda96 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/53/5by4/2019/03/19/5320bfd9a56e5883a461274e7add94a7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">The 'Queer Eye' Guys Are Horrified by Guillermo Before Giving Him a Full Makeover on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He went on to explain, "We finally got to the point, where we were like, 'Can we just sit down and talk? I didn't say any of this.' And I mean he was like, 'I didn't say any of this' and we were like, 'Why are we feuding?' And not even feuding, that sounds heavier as well like, 'Why are we not talking and being like close friends?' And he was like, 'I don't know.' Literally, the conversation went like that."</p><p>Brown then confirmed that was their one and only misunderstanding, "we haven't had a conflict since."</p><p>Brown also told TooFab he and Porowski made a pact to not let a third party get involved in their friendship again.</p><p>"We made a promise to each other of like if anybody ever tries to come between us and before we just listen to them, how about we talk to each other openly and empathetically. And I think that was the reason that we tried to do this [talk about the conflict] because we have a lot of young fans who have arguments with their friends and then it gets blown out of proportion."</p><p>"And we're just like, 'Listen, you can work through it and you can be healthy and you can like actually communicate instead of like letting rumors affect a really positive thing.'"</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
