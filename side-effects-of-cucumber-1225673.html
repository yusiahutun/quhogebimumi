This may become the best part of your hummus plate or go perfectly with your guacamole. However, recent research has shown the side effects of cucumber, which include itching, rashes, and tummy pain. What’s more? Continue reading.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=6579b31b84cb1><strong>1. May Cause Digestive Discomfort</strong></h3><p>One of the most common side effects of cucumber is gastrointestinal discomfort. Cucumbers are widely known for their hydrating properties and abundant fiber content, yet some individuals may encounter stomach discomfort following their consumption. Our contributor Corrigan Duffy, Chef and food blogger explains the reasons for discomfort, saying, “Digestive discomfort from cucumbers can be triggered by factors like excessive consumption, improper preparation, or individual sensitivities to certain compounds in cucumbers.” The considerable fiber content in cucumbers, especially in their skin, can potentially lead to gastrointestinal problems like acidity, bloating, and diarrhea (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2153876/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","3","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>3</u></a>).</p><p>The fiber content of cucumbers may raise concerns, particularly for individuals with sensitive digestive systems or those susceptible to gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548066/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","4","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>4</u></a>).</p><p>To mitigate these digestive issues, it is recommended to moderate your cucumber intake and observe how your body responds. Some people may find that peeling the cucumber or removing the seeds helps alleviate symptoms, as these parts can be harder to digest. Additionally, incorporating cucumbers into meals alongside other easily digestible foods or cooking them lightly may also help reduce digestive distress.</p><h3 id=6579b31b84cb7><strong>2. May Cause Allergic Reactions</strong></h3><p><img alt="side effects of cucumber" title="side effects of cucumber" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-06/1686740000_shutterstock_1421544041.jpg></p><p>Although rare, some people may develop allergic reactions to cucumbers. This can manifest as itching, swelling, hives, or even difficulty breathing. Allergies to cucumbers are often due to a protein called chitinase (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2649864/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","5","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>5</u></a>).&nbsp; In the case of any previously known allergies to fruits such as melons or zucchini, you may be at a higher risk of experiencing a cucumber allergy as well.</p><p>Cucumber allergies typically fall under the category of oral allergy syndrome (OAS), also known as pollen-food syndrome. OAS occurs when proteins in certain foods, such as cucumbers, resemble proteins found in pollen. If you are allergic to certain pollen, such as ragweed or birch pollen, your immune system may mistake cucumber proteins for pollen proteins and trigger an allergic reaction (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4655061/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","6","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>6</u></a>).</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>The severity of allergies varies from mild swelling in the mouth or throat to severe symptoms such as anaphylaxis. If you suspect you have a cucumber allergy or experience any concerning symptoms after consuming cucumbers, it is crucial to seek medical attention promptly.</p><h3 id=6579b31b84cc5><strong>3. Exposure to Pesticide Toxicity</strong></h3><p>When cucumbers are consumed without proper washing or if non-organic varieties are chosen, there is a risk of ingesting pesticide residues. Pesticide residues can be present on the skin or even penetrate into the flesh of the cucumber. These residues can vary depending on the specific pesticides used, farming practices, and regulations in different regions (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19237184/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","7","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>7</u></a>).</p><p>When the human body is exposed to pesticides for a prolonged period, this may lead to severe chronic health issues. This may range from the likelihood of specific cancers to genetic modifications, hormonal imbalances, and disruptions in reproductive systems. Hence, to avoid this risk, it is best to opt for organic ones and consume them after peeling the skin of the cucumber.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=6579b31b84cca><strong>4. May Cause Kidney Problems</strong></h3><p>Cucumbers have a diuretic effect, meaning they can increase urine production. While this can be beneficial for flushing out toxins and promoting kidney health, excessive consumption of cucumber juice, particularly in the evening, may lead to frequent urination (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19863854/#:~:text=By%20causing%20increased%20formation%20of,cause%20urinary%20urgency%20and%20incontinence.","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","8","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>8</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The main reason why cucumbers have diuretic properties is because they contain a significant amount of water and specific compounds, including caffeic acid and potassium. These compounds have a mild diuretic effect, stimulating the kidneys to produce and eliminate more urine (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19863854/#:~:text=By%20causing%20increased%20formation%20of,cause%20urinary%20urgency%20and%20incontinence.","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","8","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>8</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h3 id=6579b31b84cce><strong>5. May Lead to an Imbalance of Body Electrolytes</strong></h3><p><img alt="side effects of cucumber" title="side effects of cucumber" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-06/1686740207_shutterstock_1575539137.jpg></p><p>The high water content of cucumbers makes them a refreshing option in salads. While water is surely essential for overall body fluids, what is more important is electrolyte balance. Low sodium levels in cucumber juice, when consumed daily, may lead to an imbalance of body electrolytes (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330442483_EFFECT_OF_CUCUMBER_CUCUMIS_SATIVUS_JUICE_ON_LOWERING_BLOOD_PRESSURE_IN_ELDERLY","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","9","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>9</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>For individuals following a low-sodium diet or those with specific medical conditions requiring sodium restriction, excessive pickled cucumber consumption can disrupt electrolyte balance. Inadequate sodium intake can hinder fluid retention and the proper concentration of electrolytes, leading to symptoms like muscle cramps, dizziness, weakness, and fatigue (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4080605/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","10","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>10</u></a>).</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Hence, to prevent this, one may consume a well-balanced diet. If you're on a low-sodium diet, it's important to monitor your cucumber intake and incorporate other sources of electrolytes, such as potassium-rich foods like bananas or avocados, to ensure a healthy balance.</p><h3><strong>6. May Cause Blood Clotting&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>One cup of cucumber contains your daily dose of vitamin K. Since cucumbers are rich in vitamin K, eating too many of them may alter the blood coagulation process (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5726210/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","11","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>11</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Consuming high amounts of vitamin K can potentially interfere with the effectiveness of certain blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin (a blood thinner for heart patients), which are prescribed to individuals at risk of excessive blood clotting (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0954-6820.1975.tb19538.x","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","12","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>12</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>7. May Increase Photosensitivity&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Some individuals may experience heightened photosensitivity or sunburn-like symptoms after consuming large quantities of cucumber. This reaction is more likely to occur if you have a condition called vitiligo or if you are taking medications that increase photosensitivity (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8814735/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","13","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>13</u></a>).</p><p>Cucumber contains certain compounds called psoralens, which can make the skin more sensitive to sunlight. Psoralens are known to react with UV radiation and can trigger skin reactions like sunburn or rashes in susceptible individuals (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8814735/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","13","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>13</u></a>). For people who suffer from PMLE or are taking medications like certain antibiotics, diuretics, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that increase photosensitivity, consuming large amounts of cucumber may exacerbate these effects.</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;8. May Increase the Formation of Kidney Stones</strong></h3><p><img alt="side effects of cucumber" title="side effects of cucumber" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-06/1686740225_shutterstock_1525083410.jpg></p><p>Excessive intake of high-oxalate foods, including cucumbers that come under the Cucurbitaceae family, and contain a moderate amount of oxalates, can potentially contribute to the formation of kidney stones or worsen existing kidney stone conditions in certain individuals (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6261200/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","14","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>14</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible for oxalates to mix with calcium to create crystals, which can build up and cause kidney stones to form. Consuming a lot of high-oxalate foods like cucumber may increase your chance of developing kidney stones or exacerbate your current condition if you have a history of them or if your doctor has instructed you to reduce your oxalate intake (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6459305/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","15","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>15</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>9. May Cause Discomfort During the Pregnancy</strong></h3><p>While it is considered completely safe to consume cucumber during pregnancy, there are a few things to take care of. One is the possibility of digestive issues. Being high in fiber, cucumbers may increase already ongoing digestive discomfort during pregnancy. Eating a high-fiber diet may cause gas, bloating, or an upset stomach in some individuals. While pregnancy is already making major changes to a woman’s body, this may add to those symptoms (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2153876/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","3","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>3</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Moreover, cucumbers may have a diuretic effect due to their high water content, which could potentially increase urine production and make frequent trips to the loo making you a little uncomfortable (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7527799/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","8","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>8</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>10. May Interrupt Iron Absorption&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Cucumbers are rich in phytates, which are found naturally in all plant-based foods. Phytates bind to minerals like iron and calcium in our body, which further form complex compounds. Due to this formation of compounds, the natural minerals are absorbed less by the body (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322992996_ANTI-NUTRITIONAL_POTENTIAL_MINERAL_ELEMENTS_AND_PHYTO-CONSTITUENTS_OF_CUCUMBER_FRUITS_Cucumis_sativus","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","16","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>16</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Iron is found in two forms, heme, and non-heme. Heme is found in animal-based foods, and non-heme is found in plant-based foods like cucumber (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/iron-absorption","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","17","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>17</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Non-heme iron, which is present in cucumber juice, is not as easily absorbed by the body compared to heme iron. The presence of phytates in cucumber juice further reduces the bioavailability of non-heme iron by binding to it and forming insoluble complexes (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15743020/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","18","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>18</u></a>).</p><p>Heat treatment, such as cooking or steaming, can help reduce the phytate content of vegetables, including cucumbers. If you're specifically looking to increase your iron absorption, consider lightly cooking or steaming your vegetables before consuming them (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","10 Unknown Side Effects of Cucumber to Know About ","1225673","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325021/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/side-effects-of-cucumber-1225673","19","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>19</u></a>).</p><h2><strong>How to Avoid </strong><strong>Side Effects of Cucumbers</strong><strong>?</strong></h2><p><img alt="side effects of cucumber" title="side effects of cucumber" width=1000 height=667 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-06/1686740261_shutterstock_195114818.jpg></p><p>To minimize the potential side effects of consuming cucumbers or cucumber juice, consider the following tips:</p><h3><strong>1. Consume in Moderation</strong></h3><p>Our contributor Corrigan Duffy, advises, “The safe consumption of cucumbers varies among individuals, but generally, 1-2 medium-sized cucumbers per day is safe for most people.”<strong> </strong>Although cucumbers are considered the healthiest options in vegetables and go well in salads too it surely does not mean that you should overindulge in them. Consuming cucumber on an empty stomach may lead to side effects of cucumber such as bloating. Hence, try to moderate the intake while not having it on an empty stomach.</p><h3><strong>2. Rotate with Other Vegetables</strong></h3><p>Instead of relying solely on cucumbers as a daily vegetable, diversify your intake by including a variety of vegetables in your diet. This can help prevent any potential negative effects from overconsumption of cucumbers.</p><h3><strong>3. Use Organic Cucumber</strong></h3><p>If you're concerned about pesticide exposure, opt for organic cucumbers or thoroughly wash conventionally grown ones.
