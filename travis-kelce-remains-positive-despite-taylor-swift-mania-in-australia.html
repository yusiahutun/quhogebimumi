However, he probably didn’t expect the amount of attention it received. <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> called out ‘false media’ narratives from his time overseas, but still gushed over his girlfriend, who he has been dating for more than six months. His brother, <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>, said his arrival at the airport was on the same level as The Beatles due to how manic it was. The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> have been making headlines since September, as Swifties and NFL fans are happy over their union.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-arriving-in-australia-was-like-the-beatles>Travis Kelce arriving in Australia was like ‘The Beatles’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1736565364-1024x818.jpg><p>On the latest episode of their <a href=#>New Heights podcast they told their fans, the 92%ers</a>, about Trav’s trip Down Under.</p><p>At first the 34-year-old joked the segment was about his older brother ‘getting out of the house’, but really, it was the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> player.</p><p>Jason says: “Travis traveled Down Under and we got to talk about it – Trav, what the hell is your life doing right now?</p><p>“Gee, I have no idea,” Travis laughs. “A lot of false media, being tossed out there, I tell you what wasn’t false when I landed in Australia and seeing all the cameras.</p><p>“Hey, you’re like The Beatles,” the 36-year-old declared, making his younger brother chuckle, before saying he’s <a href=#>Yoko Ono – the late John Lennon’s partner</a>. Then the tight end seemed to get the singer mixed up with speed skater Apolo Anton Ono</p><p>“Dude, it’s a wild ride,” Travis continued, “but I will tell you this, Australia, did not disappoint. It was amazing over there.”</p><p>He added: “Sydney was a beautiful city, the layout I don’t want to say was similar to Miami but a lot of coastal areas, let alone the zoo and seeing all the exotic animals. It was fun.”</p><p>Jason then shakes his head and asks: “Were there drones above your head? Where did all this footage come from?”</p><p>Travis Kelce added about the Australia frenzy: “No, there were full on helicopters flying around. This is because Taylor is the biggest and best thing possible.”</p><p>“Yeah, of course,” Jason agreed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-encounter-with-a-red-panda>Travis’ encounter with a red panda</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>💬 | Travis Kelce on visiting the Sydney Zoo with Taylor and getting tracked down by the press:</p><p>"They helicoptered us. Well not us, Taylor. This is all because Taylor is the biggest and best thing possible" <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9wuggJLt2j</a></p>— Taylor Swift Updates 🩶 (@swifferupdates) <a href=#>March 6, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>The athlete continued talking up the facility and how he managed to see a red panda up close. His brother quipped how red pandas look more like racoons than pandas, despite their name.</p><p>“It looked like a friendly racoon,” Travis reassured him.</p><p>“One of my favorite things is the zoo keeper showing us the red panda, explained we had to go in a cage to go see it, we had to go in the ‘panda area’. They were like ‘alright, make sure that door is closed and when you get out of here, quickly close this one as they are escape artists’.</p><p>“This thing got so much brownie points from me, dude. ‘How much does this little thing get out?’</p><p>“They are sneaky individuals”.</p><p>The former Philadelphia Eagles center, <a href=#>who announced he is retiring from football</a> this week, pondered if any animal that looks like it is wearing a mask is a sneaky fella. He compared the red panda to racoons again, detailing his hypothesis for both creatures.</p><p>He then seemed upset there were no ‘exotic’ animals in the zoo to Australia, say American species. But Travis explained, other than an alligator, there were common zoo animals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-are-better-than-this>‘We are better than this’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-2004264414-1024x683.jpg><p>Reddit fans, upon hearing about the media coverage were shocked at the lengths taken over how some photos were snapped of <a href=#>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift in Australia</a>.</p><p>One fan wrote: “At least they still managed to enjoy themselves. But holy hell that is so screwed up. Taking pictures from a balcony is one thing. But helicopters? We are better than this.”</p><p>A second said: “It’s nice that he’s being diplomatic, probably out of respect that it’s her tour in another country. But I would totally have understood if he called them out. The helicopters were overkill.”</p><p>And a third echoed: “Travis’s whirlwind trip to Sydney to support Taylor for her opening night of the Eras Tour received media coverage like it was the Super Bowl he had just won including their visit to the Sydney Zoo. It really is because she is the most famous person in the world even as creepy as it can be at times with those overhead aerial shots of them walking around.”</p><p>While a fourth Swiftie penned: “Love his positive attitude on all this. I’m sure it means so much to Taylor and just makes everything easier and happier to deal with.</p><p>“Cannot wait to see them reunited!”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WEcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGapnqWRnru0ec%2BoqqKsmauybrDErKeirJViwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecyapaKZXZ67bq3UrKurmZyernA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alia-bhatt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alia Bhatt - All You Need to Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jenna-bush-hager-today-shocks-hoda-kotb-family-anecdote.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Today's Jenna Bush Hager shocks Hoda Kotb with family vacation anecdote</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
