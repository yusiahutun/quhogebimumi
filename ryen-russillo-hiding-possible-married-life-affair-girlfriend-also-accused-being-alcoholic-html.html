But when it comes to his personal life, he prefers keeping his mouth shut. He is someone who works for the media but keeps his personal life far from the eyes of media.</p><p>Those who respect his professional contributions would also like to know what this experienced journalist is beyond the screen. Does he have a married life apart from his working life which he has kept far from the vulture eyes of the media or has a girlfriend in his life? We also take a look at some of the issues he has found himself tangled in.&nbsp;</p><h2>Russilo&nbsp;Keeping Wife/Girlfriend Away From The Spotlight?</h2><p>Russilo is a good looking and accomplished journalist, and&nbsp;he is sure to have attracted a lot of ladies in his life. But does this man have a wife or a girlfriend in his life? It is what people often wonder when it comes to stalking his personal life. Well, so far, he is less likely to be a married man and have a wife in his life as he is yet to reveal anything about his tying the holy knot. Or maybe, he might have done so but does not want the people to know about it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><img alt height=560 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/celebrity/Ryen.jpg width=790 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Caption: Ryen Russilo has not given the fans and media any clue about his romantic life.</strong></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Photo Credit: alchetron.com</p><p>But he has always been diplomatic when answering questions about him having a lady in his life. An example of this was spotted when he was a part of a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">chat</a>.&nbsp;When he was asked if he has a girlfriend or a wife by a person named Jess, he replied,&nbsp;</p><p>new girlfriend. Jess, I hope this isn't from a dude</p><p>However, that is all from him, and he has not revealed anything else regarding his love life. We now can assume that he&nbsp;is less vocal about his love life and marital status. So we might have to wait and see, whether the journalist himself gives the fans and media something to get excited about!</p><h2>Russilo: And The Issues.</h2><p>Russilo has not lacked being on the spotlight when it comes to his professional life. But this one time, he was in the spotlight for a reason he would not be happy glancing back.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Let us take you back to early 2012 when Russilo was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">slammed</a>&nbsp;by WEEI broadcasting personality John Dennis and called him a "stumbling drunk alcoholic." The two have had quite the history with one another as once back in 2005, Dennis blasted&nbsp;Russilo for trying to seduce his daughter.</p><p>But the old feud came to further firing when Russilo was ejected forcibly from ESPN's Super Bowl party. Russilo and Dennis were also engaged in a Twitter war, but the tweets were deleted later.</p><p>Not only that, but he was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">suspended </a>by the ESPN for an indefinite&nbsp;period following the real incident with the Boston, radio host. However, the details of the incident remain confidential. Moreover, ESPN's PR remain silent about his incident.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, no official statement from Russilo has come forth regarding this incident. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Regardless of the issues that surround him, he is a successful professional and has touched greater height&nbsp;in his career. Reports&nbsp;suggest that he earns an annual salary of around $95 thousand and that must have made a substantial effect on his net worth as well. Hwever, he is yet to reveal the exact figure of his salary and net worth.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZquxlaN6s8HSrKClpJ9itaqwyKeeZqifqMCqrsueZKaZoqe2prCMpaCfnV2Ws6etyKtkoKGiobOztcSnm2aZnKi8bq3CnKysnZRir6a1zaBkmqSTpLWwuMicZaGsnaE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lopez-and-casper-smart.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>JLo &amp;amp; Casper</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./661313fc321adf002541530c-directo-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Primer Debate Presidencial 2024 EN VIVO por internet.
