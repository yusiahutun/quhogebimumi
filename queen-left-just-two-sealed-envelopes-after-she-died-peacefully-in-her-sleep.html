The public wasn’t informed of her ill health until hours before the final announcement, which saw her family members, including <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and William rush to be by her bedside.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-133919600-693x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-queen-elizabeth-died-peacefully-without-any-pain>Queen Elizabeth died peacefully without any pain</h2><p>The new <a href=#>royal</a> book Charles III: New King. New Court. The Inside Story, states the Queen died peacefully in her sleep, and wouldn’t have been aware of ‘what was going on’.</p><p>Author Robert Hardman had access to the Queen’s personal aide’s memo, at the time of her death in Balmoral, which stated the monarch died “peacefully in her sleep.”</p><p>It also stressed she wouldn’t have had any pain, and would not have been aware of anything at the time. “Very peaceful. In her sleep. Slipped away. Old age. She wouldn’t have been aware of anything. No pain,”&nbsp;Sir Edward Young is said to have written in the memo.</p><p>In new information, the book also claims the 96-year-old left a “sealed deathbed letter” for her eldest son, <a href=#>King Charles</a>, as well as her private secretary, Sir Edward Young.</p><p>However, despite knowing the information, it is not known what was written in the letters, and Hardman writes it probably never will be public.</p><p>It does show, however, she was aware of what was happening, and that her life was coming to an end, without any pain.</p><p>Buckingham Palace said it would not be commenting on the “unauthorized” biography.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-princess-anne-was-by-her-mother-s-side-but-kept-humor-in-tragic-events>Princess Anne was by her mother’s side – but kept humor in tragic events</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-802204820-1024x687.jpg><p>It was a widely known fact that the Queen’s daughter, Princess Anne was by her bedside. The new book states Charles was on his way back to Balmoral from his nearby estate when he revived the news of his mother’s death.</p><p>Charles’ younger sister was reportedly waiting outside Balmoral to greet her brother, the new King, after the sad news, when a worker is said to have given her a hug.</p><p>Touching a member of the royal family without invitation is seen as a breach of <a href=#>royal protocol</a>, but it looks like the Princess didn’t seem to mind.</p><p>Speaking on the moment, Hardman writes: “There then followed a wry smile. ‘That is the last time that’s going to happen,’ the Princess said firmly.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aEcL3UnpynZZyas7V5ya6qrWWkrLxuv8Sao56cXZq7t7HLqKeeq12Ws7Wx0WaqoZ1dmbamsIypnJqblZvCrbjYZqCnZZiav26%2Fy56cqWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ricki-lake-reveals-further-weight-loss-surpassing-goal-140lbs-best-shape-of-life-55.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ricki Lake reveals further weight loss after surpassing goal of 140lbs</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./molly-sims.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Molly Sims - Bio, Age, Career, Net Worth, Height, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
