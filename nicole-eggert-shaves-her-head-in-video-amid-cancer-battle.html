Beastie Boys’ “Fight For Your Right” played during the video. Toward the end, Nicole’s daughter Keegan appeared to help her finish shaving her head.</p><p>“Maybe healing involves not so much changing ourselves but allowing ourselves to be who we are – Madeleine Eames,” the caption of the post read.</p><p>The video garnered supportive comments from several celebrities and fans, including <strong>Jennie Garth</strong>, <strong>Kaycee Stroh</strong> and <strong>Erika Eleniak</strong>.</p><p>“Grace. You have the most grace. It’s inspiring and I appreciate you,” <strong>Alyssa Milano</strong> commented on <a href=#>the video</a>.</p><p>Nicole was diagnosed with stage 2 cribriform carcinoma breast cancer in December 2023. She visited a doctor after finding a lump in her breast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nicole-eggert-shaves-head.jpg><p>“It really was throbbing and hurting,” she told <a href=#>People</a> in January. “I immediately went to my general practitioner and she told me I had to immediately go get it looked at. But the problem was I just couldn’t get an appointment. Everything was booked. So I had to wait until the end of November to get it done.”</p><p>After receiving her diagnosis, the T.J. Hooker alum admitted that it’s been a difficult road.</p><p>“This journey’s been rough for me. This hasn’t been a breezy sale through life,” she shared. “I always read inspirational quotes and corny stuff, but it gets me through.”</p><p>A <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> page was created by one of her friends to help Nicole “afford her medical bills as well as feel secure that she won’t be left without a home for her family during this extremely trying time.”</p><p>“Once she is on the road to recovery, she intends to start a nonprofit for single parents like herself, without families, who are going through this ordeal,” the fundraiser website says. She is also a mom to daughter Dilyn.</p><p>“As a single mom, she’s had to struggle financially to raise her two daughters,” the description reads. “She still has a little one at home and she is terrified of not being able to afford the treatments and surgery necessary while also keeping a roof over their heads.”</p><p>Nicole previously shared a video while getting a shorter haircut on Instagram on February 17.</p><p>“Stay one step ahead of ur fears and u will never be defeated #fkcancer #shorthairdontcare Thank u to @michelledavidhair for laughing along with me and giving me this cute new do when I was just going to shave it all off,” she captioned the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46noJynnJp6prPGnqmtZaOdrrex0mafnqpdnbKisIyipWaumZmysHnApqCdZZOWu6Sx0WaZmqykobJw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erica-dahm.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erica Dahm Bio, Networth, Relations, Height, Age, and Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chelsie-hightower.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Chelsie Hightower dating?
