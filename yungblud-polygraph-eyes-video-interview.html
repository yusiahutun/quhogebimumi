The socially aware British-up-and-comer, who’s shamelessly scolded the government and the upper class in his firey, punk-inspired music, turns his attention to rape culture in his new video for “Polygraph Eyes.” The visuals, like the lyrics, follow a teenage girl who goes out for a night, has a few drinks, meets a guy at a club, gets taken advantage of and wakes up the next morning in bed with him with little recollection of what happened.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nineteen-year-old Yungblud, born Dominic Harrison, saw a lot of these scenarios while growing up in Northern England. “I would see drunk girls stumbling out of nightclubs and getting into taxis with boys that were just not nearly as drunk as them,” he says in our interview. But he didn’t realize it was wrong until he grew up and moved to London at sixteen. “That's just crazy,” he adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What’s notable is that in the scenario Yungblud sings about, the abuse isn’t obvious. In fact, to some, it might be questionable. But that’s the point—sexual assault and harassment aren’t limited to forced, vulgar acts; they also include instances with “gray areas,” manipulation and situations where men feel entitled and where women don’t explicitly say “yes.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"It's not forcing someone against their will, it's taking advantage of a situation."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We're brought up in this society where this 'lad mentality' is just so vastly accepted,” Yungblud continues, citing bro culture. “It's not black or white, it's not forcing someone against their will, it's taking advantage of a situation. Just because a girl wears a short skirt or wants to get as drunk as she wants, people think that they can take advantage of that fact and make the girl almost feel obliged to do that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yungblud warns pushy guys in the chorus: “Leave it alone mate, she doesn't want to go home with ya.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The video is gritty and raw (“I just needed it to be like a Skins episode,” he explains), but the realness helps drive his message across. “I didn't want the boy to be totally an outright f*cking maniac, because that's not it. I want boys to watch this video and go, 'Oh my God, I've done that,' or a girl to watch this video and go, 'Oh my God, that's happened to me,’” he adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harrison also wanted to make sure his project broke the mold. “If I have to see another video with guns and cars and money and 'hoes,' I'm gonna be sick,” he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch Yungblud’s full “Polygraph Eyes” video above, and learn more about his music from his interview with BAZAAR.com below.</p><img alt="Performance, Entertainment, Music, Singing, Microphone, Performing arts, Singer, Musician, Music artist, Pop music, " title="Performance, Entertainment, Music, Singing, Microphone, Performing arts, Singer, Musician, Music artist, Pop music, " fetchpriority=high width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yungblud-embed-916051870-1521008613.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">He wrote "Polygraph Eyes" from a male perspective to encourage men to talk about, and fight, sexual assault.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I just think right now, everything is coming from the women. I think it's so important for boys to talk about it, because boys need to realize, 'Oh my God, I've done that,' because it's still clouded. People do not realize that they are doing the wrong thing. Some people go, 'Oh, whatever' and push boundaries and push boundaries, and just wake up the next morning, and the girl is mortified next to him and it doesn't even resonate to them. In the video, he's just kind of like, 'You want a cup of tea?' And it's like, what? That's why it needs to be spoken about from a male perspective, to dilute and smash the shit of this lad mentality that's been so vastly accepted."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">But he’s inspired by the women who have been speaking out.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Right now the movement of female empowerment that's going on is just so incredible. Initially, I couldn't quite believe it's taken us this long to get here."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">The biggest concern he had about the song was its sound.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I was releasing this song, I was nervous as shit because, obviously sonically, it's a different approach. But as an artist, I never want to be genre-defined. I love Kanye West as much as I love The Clash. I love Lorde as much as I love the Arctic Monkeys. So why can I not take a string section and write a song that's so beautiful that has an underlying message?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I wanted to trick people. Initially, I wanted it to be so catchy, so beautiful, so cinematic, that you're singing it and you don't even know what it means until the third time you listen to it. And it's that embedded in your mind, it forces you to think and talk about it."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Yungblud makes sure his music has a message.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The whole ethos of me is talking about issues that make me mad or make my friends mad, or just fundamentally saying what I think. I felt a lot, in my life, not very listened to. I don't want to tell people what to think, because who the hell am I to do that? That's just bullshit because all you can ever be is yourself. I just want to encourage people to say what they think."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">He wrote the politically charged “<u><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2TiCkNF610" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="King Charles" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">King Charles</a></u>,” and many other songs off his new EP, right after Brexit.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I had just turned 18, I could have my say. I could finally say what I wanted to say. And the other generation robbed me of what I wanted to do. And that was it, I was just like, 'F*ck it,' and I just wrote 'King Charles' and then after that I wrote 'I Love You, Will You Marry Me,' and then it all came out in a period of like a month."</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">You can love him or hate him, as long as you understand him.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"At the end of the day, just do your thing. People are gonna love me or they're gonna hate me. That's just the way it is, that's music, that's art. So as long as people hear me and go, 'I understand that. That is the shittest thing in the world, but I understand it,' or 'That is the best thing in the world, I understand it.' I don't care."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Listen to Yungblud's self-titled EP here.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
