the director of Chulalongkorn University’s Institute of Security and International Studies in Thailand, said China’s top diplomat “would want to resuscitate this rail project, otherwise there is no purpose or no use having a railway all the way from Vientiane but not coming through Thailand.”</p>Analysts said Thailand’s strategic location and its potential for sea, air and rail links across Southeast Asia was the chief draw for China, and an integral part of Beijing’s <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Belt and Road</span></a> ambitions in the region.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Part of the vision consists of the high-speed rail line running from Kunming to Singapore, criss-crossing across several Southeast Asian countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Contrary to perceptions that some of these countries may have little bargaining power vis-à-vis China, Selina Ho, a Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy international affairs professor at the National University of Singapore, said factors such as location, size, and state capacity had given some Southeast Asian nations leeway in negotiating and implementing their part of the railway project with China.</p>Thailand’s location at the hub of the proposed eastern, central and western lines had given it significant leverage, Ho said, referring to the tracks that would eventually pass through <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0

their negotiations with China, Ho added, and likewise for Singapore, a country with good state capacity.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho was speaking at a recent online event organised by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s Institute for Emerging Market Studies to mark the launch of her book Rivers of Iron: Railroads and Chinese Power in Southeast Asia co-authored with David Lampton and Cheng-Chwee Kuik.</p>The authors argued that individual countries had what it took to control, shape, and even take advantage of Chinese efforts in creating the high-speed railway connecting China and its seven Southeast Asian neighbours: <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=#

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other bargaining tools that Southeast Asian countries had in negotiations with China were their domestic politics and public opinion, Ho added.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pointing to Malaysia and Indonesia where leaders had been attacked “for selling their countries to China”, Ho said concerns over how and whether locals would benefit and whether jobs would be created could strengthen these countries’ bargaining positions.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They can tell China, look, I am putting my domestic position at stake here, you have to give me more concessions,” Ho said.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage

css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Turning to the difficulties faced by China in the construction of the railway, Ho cited Chinese companies’ unfamiliarity with the different political systems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A case in point is in Indonesia where land acquisition – the first step in the construction process – often resulted in delays due to resistance from local governments, Ho said, pointing out that 29 districts and 95 villages in West Java were directly affected by the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway construction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“So you can imagine the amount of difficulties Chinese construction companies face, as they deal with powerful local authorities, and the very strong land tenure laws in Indonesia,” Ho said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other issues such as bureaucratic resistance, compensation for the loss of land, labour laws, procurement standards, environmental protection, even the clearing of unexploded landmines had also made the process a steep learning curve for the Chinese, Ho added,</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=#

There is a lot of trial and error, a lot of learning in the process,” Ho said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kuik, who is head of the Centre for Asian Studies at the National University of Malaysia’s Institute of Malaysian and International Studies, said China’s railway construction had not gone unnoticed by other powers who had come up with alternatives such as the EU-Asia Connectivity Strategy aimed at improving Europe’s economic connectivity to the emerging economies of Southeast Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Turning to the wider picture of China’s experience in building infrastructure around the world, long-time China watcher David Lampton said China had learned and adapted from the problems and experiences it had encountered elsewhere, and was now paying greater attention to risk analysis as part of its project assessment and approval process.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beijing had also learnt that its partner countries were not only concerned with its ability to construct large projects quickly and competitively, but also with quality and long-term viability, said the professor emeritus at Johns Hopkins-SAIS.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/video/thumbnail/beltandroad_thumbnail_landscape.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In recent years, China has undertaken massive infrastructure-building efforts in Africa, Latin America, as well as South and Southeast Asia in projects ranging from rail, roads and ports to dams, power plants and bridges.</p>Some of the problems China faced, Lampton said, included terrorist attacks against Chinese workers in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Pakistan</span></a>, which had forced Beijing to pay greater attention to physical security for its citizens abroad.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Venezuela, where China has found itself committing enormous funds to what has turned out to be an insolvent regime under Hugo Chavez, Beijing had learned the importance of undertaking greater political and financial risk assessment “that was up to global standards”, Lampton said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/10/13/ee23fd58-0c71-11eb-94e0-02af7fd927c6_1320x770_112814.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Set up in 2016, the AIIB is aimed at offering finance to infrastructure projects, and has promised high standards of governance based on international best practices.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Turning to the recurrent problem of China using its own workers, materials and equipment in overseas projects – moves which have been criticised by host countries – Lampton said Beijing appeared more sensitive to this problem now than in the past.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But the pressure is still very great to maximise Chinese materials and labour to meet domestic employment and economic growth targets, even if it creates tensions with the project country,” Lampton said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the whole, China was learning how to be a more formidable international competitor, Lampton said, even though the progress appeared “slow and uneven”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Vijitra Duangdee</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Asian leaders learn art of negotiating on railway projects</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxKaxymaYrKGRZL2wuMitoJyrX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2FlgnKEkmiuoZmkYrCptc2aqmarpKfCqLPLnqpmrJiWtm6%2BwKKjsJmpYsCixYyamaitpGKvprjTZpinnF2nvKKw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cindy-mello.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Cindy Mello dating?
