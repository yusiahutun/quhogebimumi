All the trappings of Shonda Rhimes's take on Regency London are present and accounted for: so, so many balls, over-the-top sumptuous costumes, a corgi, and, of course, the sexy scenes that had fans flush the first time around.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Breakout star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>Simone Ashley</a>, who plays Kate Sharma in season 2, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that filming those scenes wasn't an issue for her and that the whole thing was choreographed in a way that made her feel safe and protected.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that she was glad that she could represent dark-skinned, Indian women in a way that's not usually seen on TV shows.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was very confident," she said. "I felt very safe. I felt very protected. I was very excited to be doing these scenes where we can show a dark-skinned woman and her body and not be so taboo about it. Especially a dark-skinned Indian woman where maybe they're represented in a conservative way sometimes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She and (spoiler) co-star Jonathan Bailey worked well together, she noted, which made the experience that much better for both of them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Johnny was an amazing co-partner to work with," she explained. "We worked with an amazing intimacy coordinator who ensured that it was choreographed and it was a safe space where we could communicate and make sure that we knew exactly what was going to be happening on the day. And I think that's something that Johnny and I had throughout the whole series. We always had each other's backs and made sure that each other, as much as we were doing our own work and we were on our own journeys, we would always check in with one another and make sure that they were OK."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bailey also spoke about working with Ashley, saying that he knew it would be tough for someone new to the cast to jump into something as intimate as a sex scene.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For a man, it is less exposing," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>The Sunday Times</a>.
