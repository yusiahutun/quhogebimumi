There’s never a shortage of tasty sides, decadent desserts and, of course, there’s always the turkey! Even celebrities have a similar menu when it comes to their Thanksgiving day meal. From candied yams to pumpkin pie, some major stars have dished on the things they’re cooking for their Thanksgiving celebration.</p><p>Read on to find out these celebrities favorite Thanksgiving dishes…</p><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></a></p><p>Katie Holmes has been carrying on one of her family’s Thanksgiving traditions for years, no matter where in the world she may be. The actress says her mom makes pumpkin bars each year and even if she’s away traveling on the holiday, she’s sure to make them too.</p><p>"My mom started a tradition where she makes these amazing pumpkin bars -- almost like a pumpkin cake with cream cheese frosting, but it’s not too spicy. In my family we travel so much and we’re constantly living in hotels, so my daughter and I have been in the living room of the hotel with powdered sugar going everywhere making this to keep up the tradition. They’re really gooey and moist," Katie told <a href=#>Access Hollywood</a>.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a></p><p>Gigi Hadid is a big fan of making Thanksgiving desserts and says she’s the one bringing the pies to the party. Meanwhile, the rest of her family covers the main meal -- from the turkey all the way to the buttered carrots.</p><p>"I always make pies for Thanksgiving. I’m the pie girl. I love rhubarb pie, I love apple pie and pumpkin pie and blackberry pie -- but sometimes that mixes with the rhubarb into one [pie]," she told <a href=#>WWD</a>. "My dad does really good stuffing and all of the meat, and my mom is the best for buttered carrots and cranberry Jell-O, or whatever you call it. <a href=#>Bella</a> does dessert. Anwar just eats, and I do pie."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b6a99a5f-9f38-4cae-8491-daa1f27fab58 data-container-ref=toofab:article:792f1986-b8b2-414b-89f4-3d843c9dedbf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/70/5by4/2022/09/16/70fe6865b0c14289a816b671ba99bc28_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Gigi Hadid's Dad Weighs In On Her Rumored Romance with Leonardo DiCaprio</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></a></p><p>Since Kristen Bell is a vegetarian, she says tofurkey is a staple in her Thanksgiving meal. Her parents first started making it when Kristen stopped eating meat and now she continues the tradition each year.</p><p>"Tofurkey. It's a faux turkey that my parents always made for me because I've always been a vegetarian. It's awesome. It's so great. You'll have to try it!" &nbsp;Kristen told <a href=#>InStyle</a>.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a></p><p>Kelly Ripa says she doesn’t actually eat turkey on Thanksgiving following a mishap one year which left her family with a ton of guests and a half raw turkey. Instead, they now focus on other Thanksgiving staples and "protein alternatives."</p><p>"Joaquin is really big on the sage and butter pork chop. He loves it so much! My daughter is more like my people. We like a whipped mashed potato, but we also like a mashed sweet potato. We like anything mashed and carbohydrate," <a href=#>Kelly said</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5b148945-eea3-4feb-be05-da1e22117b29 data-container-ref=toofab:article:792f1986-b8b2-414b-89f4-3d843c9dedbf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b9/5by4/2022/11/04/b925d2589bb34bc39449a0f69aae2fbf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Pictionary's Jerry O'Connell Credits Kelly Ripa with His String of Hosting Gigs (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a></p><p>For the past 15 years, Sarah Jessica Parker says she and her family are sure to have &nbsp;pumpkin pies from New York’s Little Pie Company on their Thanksgiving table. The family actually loves the pies so much, they order as many as possible -- and sometimes run out of places to store them!</p><p>"We put them on the floor of the laundry room or in the back of a minivan where it’s cold. We put them outside because they don’t fit in the fridge, and we eat the pies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My daughter, Tabitha, goes crazy for them," Sarah Jessica told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a></p><p>Jennifer Garner’s Thanksgiving meal tradition was started by her grandmother Exie, who always made a sweet potato pudding. The actress explained that her family carries on the tradition of the side dish -- which is practically a dessert.</p><p>"We always make my grandmother Exie’s sweet potato pudding with marshmallows roasted on top. It is sweet and gooey and hardly even counts as a vegetable by the time we’re through but it is our family’s big-time, forever tradition," Jennifer told <a href=#>Modern Mom</a>.</p><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>Laura Prepon</strong></a></p><p>Laura Prepon is always guaranteed a delicious Thanksgiving meal because her mother is a gourmet chef! Each year she makes incredible candied yams and helps deep fry the turkey.</p><p>"My mom's candied yams...She's like a gourmet chef, so she's amazing. She has these little mini marshmallows that are roasted on the top that are so good. And you know what the key is about a turkey? Deep-frying it. It's so yummy. It's the way to go," Laura shared with <a href=#>InStyle</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f7758cc0-1250-5916-9ed3-a1223a1d6feb data-container-ref=toofab:article:792f1986-b8b2-414b-89f4-3d843c9dedbf data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d8/5by4/2020/03/26/d8129f1a99f35b519a0e3983f6999f95_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Laura Prepon Reveals She and Ben Foster Terminated Second Pregnancy</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Tamera Mowry</strong></a></p><p>Each year, Tamera Mowry makes her famous garlic mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving. She shared that part of the secret to her great potatoes is whipping it with real butter and milk.</p><p>"I have been making my garlic mashed potatoes for about 10 years.

I can't tell my secret," Tamera said in an interview with <a href=#>Hip Hollywood</a>.</p><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a></p><p>All of Tori Spelling’s family contribute to the meal on Thanksgiving! While Tori’s green bean bundles wrapped in bacon have become her staple item, her children have found their own specialties.</p><p>"Stella has great skills in the kitchen. She usually bakes all the desserts. Liam, our picky eater, will try anything as long as he’s had a hand in preparing the dish, which is great. Hattie and Finn try to help but usually end up snacking the whole time. And Jack is my best taster. [Dean is] Canadian, so he introduced poutine in a fun kid-approved presentation, potato bug poutine. And he has a famous stuffing that he makes with bagels instead of bread. It’s delicious!"
