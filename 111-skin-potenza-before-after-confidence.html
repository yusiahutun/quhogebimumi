Especially working with celebrities as they are under a lot of pressure and constant scrutiny, makeup helps them feel their best, enhances their natural beauty and is a tool to bring out their personalities.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eXs3QfV2JW- data-wc=58>"I'll do someone's makeup and they get up in the chair and start dancing, or they start feeling bouncy and that happiness transfers to me too," Lisa says of beauty's power to cheer us up, and she goes on to say that makeup is one of the most empowering ways to feel like the best version of ourselves.</p><p id=exo9JlcRLMD data-wc=30>This happiness is created because when we see a version of ourselves that we really like dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin are released in our brains, creating a warm fuzzy feeling.</p><p id=eaVrkcpR4z data-wc=14><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Why an image overhaul can genuinely make us happier - a neuroscientist explains</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Loss of confidence</strong></h3><p id=ebvXq7dwAq6 data-wc=53>Despite constantly making others feel beautiful and confident, Lisa has seen a dip in her self-esteem in recent years, explaining: "I'm in an industry where what you look like is very important, and I prefer to look natural, but as I've got older I've started wearing makeup to feel a little more confident.</p><p id=eV22GpNm_FP data-wc=38>"Because I'm constantly helping others look their best, I don't always get a chance to spend time on myself. Between the early call times, travelling and jet lag, I don't always have time to do something for myself.</p><p id=eQQ-qhqEF9S data-wc=43>"I just don't like looking old," Lisa tells HELLO! candidly, before explaining she decided to have skin-tightening treatment <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Potenza at the&nbsp;111 Harley St Clinic</a>, "to get rid of the fine lines," and help boost her confidence.</p><h3><strong>What is Potenza?</strong></h3><p id=exhWqOOEzKV data-wc=36>Potenza combines radiofrequency and microneedling to help tighten and smooth out the skin on the face, neck and around the eyes. The procedure is personalised, with your therapist able to control the depth of the treatment.</p><p id=evhDMwfBrR5 data-wc=31>For instance, if you have more wrinkles and fine lines around a particular area, you can go deeper into that area, so it's a targeted and precise approach to skin rejuvenation.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e8J-P-vFHKlv data-wc=43>Since having five sessions of Potenza, Lisa says she feels back to her confident best, telling HELLO!: "Potenza has helped rejuvenate my skin, making it look tighter and smoother, so when I have early call times, I can still feel confident makeup free.</p><p id=eaNJHaU2a-Z5 data-wc=19>"It's also made me feel more comfortable wearing my hair up again, which I haven't for a while now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c9a5e8597c69-front-on-potenza-before-after.jpg><h3><strong>Increased confidence</strong></h3><p id=eJ2c30nuvw6m data-wc=22>Confidence in our appearance is key to feeling happy, so it's no surprise that a boost in confidence has lifted Lisa's mood.</p><p id=eXWs91Vtwwyh data-wc=37>"When you’re not feeling confident it impacts your mood,” confirms confidence coach Tiwalola Ogunlesi. “If you have low self-esteem, you are more likely to see yourself through a negative lens, meaning you lack true joy and happiness."</p><p id=eAa6k-HsIKV data-wc=16><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I cried tears of joy after having treatment for my cleft lip in my thirties</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ezJSUT8qDLVV data-wc=19>Comparing ourselves to others is a confidence drain, but Lisa is quick to point out she's not doing that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f785fc36741d-profile-before-after-potenza.jpg><p id=ebYKql4p8gRo data-wc=40>"I didn't have Potenza because I want to look young like the girls on Instagram, it's about maintaining the best version of you," she said. "I feel comfortable again in my skin and it has made me feel really happy."</p><p id=eOtUs8-DdSzo data-wc=47>While Lisa's tweakment made her feel more confident and happier, neuroscientist Dr. Tara Swart, who recently underwent a<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;mood-boosting image overhaul of her own</a>, cautions we shouldn't assume we'll be happier simply by changing our appearance, and there are important things to consider before taking the plunge.</p><h3><strong>1. Make sure it feels authentic</strong></h3><p id=e_ju1mveYkW3 data-wc=31>"An appearance change can confuse our friends and family, because we no longer look like the person they know, and it takes a lot of getting used to," Dr. Tara says.</p><p id=eVb8p8JKYzbQ data-wc=11>"You need to find a transformation that feels authentic to you."</p><h3><strong>2. Don't hide your decision</strong></h3><p id=ed_hDIgitb_R data-wc=32>If you're considering changing something about yourself but wouldn't feel comfortable with people knowing, it could be a sign that it goes against your values, which could be problematic, Dr. Tara explains.</p><p id=emPJ4hs9a9 data-wc=9><strong>DISCOVER: <a class=hm-link href=#>Can changing your body co-exist with body acceptance?</a></strong></p><p id=eWSqR-IrhhYr data-wc=22>"If you feel the need to hide it, I would question what's behind the decision to have the work done," she says.</p><h3><strong>3. Do the work on the inside too</strong></h3><p id=eieuGvvqv9M4 data-wc=42>"People often want to change themselves due to a lack of confidence, but when they make the exterior change they are disappointed when they don't feel different inside," Dr. Tara explains. "External changes don't solve the problem that was on the inside."</p><p id=elgGemwEs50N data-wc=38>"If you make a change on the outside, but still feel the same on the inside, it's called cognitive dissonance. This is because what's happening on the outside doesn't mirror what's happening on the inside and vice versa."</p><p id=eE9_-NZUIP data-wc=16><strong>REAL LIFE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>When I can't face the world, my beauty routine helps pick me back up</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e3dJfZ5QEN_E data-wc=18>For example, you could look glossy and gorgeous on the outside but still feel a lack of happiness.</p><p id=eVosG1n04DOu data-wc=28>"If you want to make the change for confidence reasons, you need to really think about how it's going to improve your confidence and work on that too."</p><p id=e9RzHMy841 data-wc=21><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Find out more about Potenza at 111 Harley St. Clinic here</a></p><p id=ePl1pnhPyz data-wc=13><strong>Subscribe to <a class=hm-link href=#>Hello Happiness,</a> for your ultimate guide on how to be happier.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45tcGpxYmV8cn2QZqqkoZ5ivbDAxKexmmWSmrOwvsRmmJ%2Bslad6pLvNn6CdnZ6YsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./teruko-nakagami.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Teruko Nakagami; Billy Dee Williams Wife (Updated 2023) Age, Children, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-jordans-mom-gave-him-a-stern-warning-before-lucrative-nike-deal.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Jordan's mom gave him a stern warning before lucrative Nike deal</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
