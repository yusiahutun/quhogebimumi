Blige</b><span> is a vocal powerhouse who has conquered all areas of the entertainment world. The <a href=#>Grammy</a> winner was married once during her career to </span><b>Kendu Isaacs</b><span> from 2003 to 2016. She became a stepmom to his three children but never welcomed children of her own. <strong>Keep scrolling to see everything she has said about not having kids.&nbsp;</strong></span></p><h2><b>Who Are Mary J. Blige’s Stepkids?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Kendu was already a father to three children from a previous relationship upon meeting Mary. The manager and music producer introduced Mary to his kids, Briana, Jordan and Nas, whom she viewed as her own. In a May 2007 interview with </span><i><span>Redbook</span></i><span>, the </span><i><span>Mudbound</span></i><span> actress opened up about becoming a stepmom.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’ve been a stepmother for three years now and I love them so much,” she said. “They would ask me questions like, ‘What do we call you?’ I said, ‘Call me Mary, call me what you want. You don’t have to call me Mommy until you’re ready.’”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Does-Mary-J.-Blige-Have-Kids-Details-About-Her-Stepkids.jpg><p><span>The “Family Affair” singer went on to say that she wanted all three kids to “feel loved and secure.” In another 2009 interview with </span><i><span>People</span></i><span>, she shared what her two youngest stepkids, Jordan and Nas, were passionate about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“One [Jordan] is a film director already – she’s working on it,” the <a href=#>Academy Award</a> nominee said. “That’s her goal. And the other [Nas] is a philosopher, a public speaker. He speaks very well already.”</span></p><p><span>As for Briana, she went on to join the cast of </span><i><span>Growing Up Hip Hop</span></i><span> in 2016. Mary and Kendu split in 2016 and their divorce was finalized in 2018. Briana shared what her relationship was like with her stepmom in a September 2017 episode of the WE TV show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Me and Mary, I thought we had, like, a real thing,” she said. “I love her, and I get it. She’s going through things, so she probably can’t talk to me right now and I respect that, but to me, it’s almost like I lost somebody.”</span></p><h2><b>Does Mary J. Blige Have Biological Children?</b></h2><p><span>In the past, when posed with questions about not having children of her own, the R&B icon got candid about how her busy career played a major factor in that decision.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I don’t think I’ll do foster care or adopt, to be quite honest,” she told</span><i><span> People</span></i><span> in 2009. “I barely have time for my own children. To adopt more children and not have time for them, that [would be] poor parenting on my [part].”</span></p><p><span>In between her loaded schedule, Mary likes to spend time with her nieces and nephews. In June 2021, she posted a photo with them smiling for the camera on Instagram. She is also the godmother of </span><b>Sean “Diddy” Combs</b><span>’ son</span><b> Justin Dior Combs</b><span>. She gave the former college football star birthday wishes in a December 2021 post.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Happy Birthday to my beautiful, amazing & handsome godson @princejdc. I am beyond proud of you!!” </span><i><span>The Umbrella Academy</span></i><span> actress wrote.</span></p><p><span>In March 2022, Mary further reflected on the decision not to have children of her own during an episode of </span><i><span>E! Daily Pop</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I have nieces and nephews forever and I’m always watching how people are scrambling around for babysitters,” she admitted. “I don’t want to go through that.”</span></p><p><span>The “Everything” singer has shouted out her nieces and nephews on social media before. They were also front and center to watch their aunt receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I like my freedom,” the songstress continued. “I like being able to get up and go and move and do what I want to do. I don’t want to have to tend to someone all the time. I don’t think it’s gonna happen.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpp6rXaKus8WMo2SbpJmcsm60wK%2BcZqOZmcBusMStmKKko2Kuo7vUrWShnaJiwLWxz6Sgnatf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elle-brooke-quit-filming-infamous-30356353.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elle Brooke quit shoot with infamous male adult star after 'insides blended'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alison-nichols-signs-with-bbr-music-group.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alison Nichols Signs With BBR Music Group</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
