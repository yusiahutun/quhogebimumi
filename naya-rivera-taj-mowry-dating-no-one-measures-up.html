And even after all these years, he describes Naya as his "first everything."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:814796c3-7be3-45d8-9860-d6ed6f621cb6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9baa6661-9ed6-4243-bf8d-28ea874ae8b0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a8/5by4/2020/07/11/a831f4df15f54562a193126286ad652d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tahj Mowry Pens Emotional Tribute to Naya Rivera: 'I Have Never Stopped Loving You'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The late actress came up when he was asked his first celebrity crush growing up in a new interview with <a href=#><strong>Glamour</strong></a>. "That's easy for me," he said, quickly dropping her name.</p><p>He said that he still struggles with her passing, and remains in communication with her family. "I just want to make sure I’m respectful of that and what her family is going through," he said.</p><p>It's telling that when he was describing his "type," such as it is," Tahj said, "the main things are confidence; for her to have her own thing going as well. There’s something so sexy about a working woman. I think that’s fire."</p><p>In that response, though, he also said that he hadn't dated in a long time. He then delved a little deeper into that idea while thinking of Naya.</p><p>"I think subconsciously it’s why I never really date like that because no one really ever-- I know someday someone might, but it’s hard to measure up to the type of girl and woman she was," he said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5d54cab2-b815-4037-abcd-c8eca15a4921 data-container-ref=toofab:article:9baa6661-9ed6-4243-bf8d-28ea874ae8b0 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d7/5by4/2021/06/15/d7a29739f00049ac88fc6d0c647fce13_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ET/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Naya Rivera's Dad Says It's a 'Tough Situation' Talking to Her Son About His Late Mother</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>It's a similar sentiment to what he wrote after Naya was first discovered missing, but before her body was recovered. In those few days of hope, he wrote to her in a heartbreaking Instagram post revealing their relationship and expressing how much she still means to him.</p><p>"No woman has ever measured up [to] what you gave me or how you made me feel," he wrote. "I've never liked to admit it but I have never stopped loving you."</p><p>Now that she's gone, Tahj said that he struggles to even talk about his feelings "because they don’t even measure up to the pain that [her family] went through and are still going through."</p><p>He hasn't given up on love, though, saying he does want to meet his wife someday, and is even looking forward to the opportunity to be a father. "It does excite me to think about myself as a dad because I know I’ll give my all into it," he said.</p><a id=gallery-link-22e781e4-0bb7-5313-8ef1-3cd50d20e8af class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:22e781e4-0bb7-5313-8ef1-3cd50d20e8af data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9baa6661-9ed6-4243-bf8d-28ea874ae8b0 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ab/4by3/2018/12/20/aba76abe432b5f3ab0255dfa8ce546f7_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j29mam5fo666rYyroK%2BdopZ6ta3JZqSor6KueqWt06KloGWepHqwusRmpJ6Zo6q%2Fpr%2BMrqdo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./style-check-balmain-campaign-adds-another-feather-rihannas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Style Check: Balmain campaign adds another feather to Rihanna's cap</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./515276-cast-girl-closet-film-lifetime-roles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cast of Girl in the Closet film on Lifetime and their roles</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
