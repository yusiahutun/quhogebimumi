The guest in question was Henry Winkler, 77. The Happy Days and Barry actor appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show to discuss his writing career — he’s penned more than 30 books for kids! — and it turns out, he has plenty of wisdom to dispense off the page, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Clarkson, 40, was opening up about her daughter’s dyslexia diagnosis. “I was driving my daughter to school yesterday, and she’s dyslexic,” she shared with Winkler and her audience. “You have told me that you’re dyslexic as well. I find that amazing to tell my daughter, that you’ve written like 40 books and you’re dyslexic.” Clarkson is a mother to Remington Alexander, 6, and River Rose, 8. River is dyslexic, and Clarkson said she’s been bullied at school for not being able to read like the other kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Dyslexia is shockingly common. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One in five people</a> are diagnosed with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning disorder</a>, though some have milder forms, while others experience more severe cases. Mayo Clinic describes dyslexia as “a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words. Also called a reading disability, dyslexia is a result of individual differences in areas of the brain that process language.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Henry Winkler himself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t realize he had this learning disability</a> until age 31, when he got his stepson tested for dyslexia. Many adults, as well as children, struggle with suspicions that they are unintelligent or lazy on account of their reading difficulty. Of discovering his dyslexia, Winkler told NRP, “I went, ‘Oh my goodness, that’s me’ … I found out I wasn’t stupid, that I wasn’t lazy — that I had something with a name.” Winkler has since written a children’s book series called Here’s Hank, which follows the adventures of a dyslexic boy named Hank Zipzer.&nbsp;</p><p>If Clarkson’s daughter is struggling with feeling “othered” in school, it seems likely that support from The Fonz himself — who is a best-selling author, despite his lifelong<a href=#> battle with words</a> — may help make up for it. “She’s part of the tribe!” Winkler told Clarkson, before going on to share a message with the second grader directly: “River! How you learn has nothing to do with how brilliant you are,” Winkler said into the camera. Understandably, Clarkson began tearing up instantly. It’s been one year since she finalized her divorce <a href=#>from husband Brandon Blackstock</a> — and while separated parenting is undoubtedly hard, it seems the talk show host is showering her kids with all the tenderness and sympathy they could need.&nbsp;</p><p>Dyslexia is often considered a “hidden” disability — one that does not obviously present itself, but which may nevertheless hamper a person’s ability to achieve academically or professionally, and eventually result in a loss of self-confidence. Worried that you or your child might be dyslexic? The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">International Dyslexia Association</a> recommends you assess yourself using the following questions:</p><ul><li>Do you often have to read something two or three times before it makes sense?&nbsp;</li><li>Are you uncomfortable reading out loud?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you omit, transpose, or add letters when you are reading or writing?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you find you still have spelling mistakes in your writing even after Spell Check?</li></ul><p>If you answered yes to these questions, it may indicate dyslexia; consider seeking the opinion of a specialist or getting a formal diagnostic assessment. If you suspect that your child could be dyslexic, speak to their healthcare provider; early intervention can improve success, suggests <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p><p>Above all, let Henry Winkler’s accomplishments inspire you. As he said to Kelly Clarkson’s daughter, the way we learn — no matter how different it may be from everyone else’s way — does not have any impact on our intellect or character.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomp6klZe%2FqsDInqpoo5Whubp5wqWYq6OjpLtur9GinKxlkal6qbHNq7Bmr5mjuK2x0axkmpymnrCmedOoZKGdomKxur%2FLnq%2Bim12Zrrazx62cqw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-scherzinger-update-thom-evans-month-after-engagement.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole Scherzinger shares update on relationship with fianc Thom Evans a month after engagement</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celebrity-television1.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I'm Gary Busey and I've been clean for 13 years | Life and style</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
