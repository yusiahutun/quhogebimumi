I have not gone a single day in the past five years without this m********,” the daughter of the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> stars told the camera.</p><p>“I think me getting my boobs done is honestly going to save my life, because it’s forcing me to quit this,” she stated.</p><p>The 19-year-old then revealed she may even postpone her surgery because she’s “too scared to quit nicotine.”</p><p>“I’m so scared, I don’t know how I’m going to live without this thing, it’s really sad, my whole life revolves around it. I’ve depended on it for so long. My peak growing stages in life have been dependent on nicotine, which is really f****** bad,” Sami told the camera.</p><p>In the caption of the post, the daughter of the former <a href=#>celebrity</a> couple penned: “please don’t be mean.”</p><p>Watch Sami’s TikTok <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> here.
