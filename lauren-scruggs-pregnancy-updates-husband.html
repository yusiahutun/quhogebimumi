What's more interesting is that she is a married woman who will soon be starting a family of her own. She seems to be expecting her first baby.</span></p><p><span>Here's more to follow.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Lauren Scruggs Expecting A Baby | Pregnancy Updates</strong></span></h2><p><span>It is known that Lauren Scruggs is expecting her first baby with her husband Jason Kennedy after years of fertility struggles.</span></p><p><span>She was spotted flashing her baby bump on her Instagram in March 2022. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>dailymail.co.uk</a>, she and her husband Jason are excited with the news of the arrival of their upcoming baby.</span></p><p><span>The couple first shared the happy news with <a href=# rel=noopener>people.com</a> on 8 September 2021. Though Lauren was not up for sharing her fertility struggles with the public, they still opted to do so through social media, which further aided and encouraged other people in the community to keep going strong.</span></p><p><span>While sharing the news, Jason opened up about how his wife kept moving forward despite the difficulty that set her from conceiving a baby. Due to her pregnancy hardships, he refers to his wife as a 'legend' to do so. Jason added:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><strong>"I always knew she was amazing, but after watching her set alarms all day and night to take shots and medicine, it made me realize she can do anything.” He further thanked the health experts and other people who helped the couple in their fertility struggles. There is an overall sense of peace because of our faith in God, and then it just comes down to our incredible friends and family who walked closely with us through it all.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Although those struggling days were quite hard to get by, the couple still stayed strong and got past it, bringing them closer together.</span></p><p><span>After first opening up about their in vitro fertilization (IVF) journey in January 2021, they kept their followers updated until finally expressing their joy via Instagram. Jason shared a touching documented video of the moment he found out about Lauren's pregnancy.</span></p><p><span>As for Lauren, she shared a different video on her Instagram account, which documented her journey through IVF, doctor appointments, and medicines.</span></p><p><span>Now, the couple is more ready than ever to have a family of their own and live a blissful life together.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Relationship Details With Husband Jason Kennedy</strong></span></h2><p><span>Though life hit her hard, Lauren Scruggs is blessed with beautiful friends and family and a wonderful husband. She tied the knot with a former E! News anchor, Jason Kennedy, in 2014.</span></p><p><span>The couple shares such beautiful moments as a married pair. During the 2017's appearance of the couple at the '</span><span>Runway of Dreams Foundation Gala' in New York City on 8 June, Lauren said she wanted a dating partner who would not baby her but be "aware" of her in every step.</span></p><p><span>She seemingly got her desired partner in life since she explained that Jason was "so aware when we were dating like if we were going hiking, he would kind of loosen the top of my water bottle."</span></p><p><span>Jason was also the one to support her through her IVF journey and give an update about it via social media. Jason first shared the news of their journey through a video on his Instagram account. In the video, Jason shared that IVF is a good process.</span></p><p><span>The pair also had an emotional wedding in the last of 2014. So emotional that the groom busted out in happy tears after seeing his significant other walks down the aisle, which he had always dreamed of. Furthermore, Lauren also felt surprised as "the whole night was surreal" when "everyone came to celebrate with us… and the effort that people made was so special".</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless, some incidents also occurred during their wedding, when Kennedy's mother got her hips dislocated after tripping while getting herself ready for her son's wedding. However, his mother was immediately rushed to the hospital and treated and came out in better health in the ceremony in a wheelchair.</span></p><p><span>After their nuptials, the pair shared their big day in 'The Kennedy Wedding: Jason and Lauren Get Married' via E!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46lmK6qlaN6tK%2FRrp6gq12lv6azzZqlnLFdqr2lrdOeqmagpaivorrD</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-george-clooney-amal-twins-ella-and-alexander.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet George and Amal Clooney's twins Ella and Alexander: all we know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-transfer-files-web-sites-comics-and-rss-feeds-to-your-amazon-kindle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How To Transfer Files, Web Sites, Comics, and RSS Feeds to Your Amazon Kindle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
