Patrice Lovely is an American actress and comedian who is famous for the portrayal of Hattie Love in the sitcom Love Thy Neighbor. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-172 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Career and Progression:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Patrice Lovely started her professional career as a ringmaster at UniverSoul Circus in 2004. The actress portrayed “Auntie” at the UniverSoul Circus in 2009.&nbsp;Finally, she set her foot in acting business with the movie, A Madea Christmas as Miss Hattie in 2011.

We have barely heard her sharing about her real-life issues and relationships in the media. It is still unknown about whether or not the gorgeous actress is married. However, it’s difficult for the fans and media to conclude without the second thought that she isn’t married due to her age of 49.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><p style=text-align:justify><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikinetworth.com/uploads/patrice%20bf.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto ezimgfmt="rs rscb2 src ng ngcb2"></p><p style=text-align:justify>Patrice Lovely keeps her life as secret as she can. But in the scenario of the boyfriend, she replied to a guy as of asking the same question to herself that if she got a boyfriend and made fun of herself. Which states that she is neither curious nor interested to share her personal life in public. Moreover, it is apparent that the actress has reached the age to marry and have kids with husband. Her quiet life, therefore, leads us to assume that she may be secretly married or is dating a secret boyfriend. Despite the digging, the information about her personality is to be found nowhere. She has managed to maintain privacy even on her Instagram and Twitter account.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Her Short Bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>According to some wiki sources, Patrice Lovely was born on January 4, 1968, in Jackson, MS and grew up in Alabama. She studied at Alabama State University and resided in Atlanta, Georgia since then. She usually spends time with her family and friends. She has a sweet height of 5 feet 1 inches and curly hair which enhances her feminine personality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2r7HTsKarrJhjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1tcSsZqmZpKe2pLGMpaavnZyueri1yqJkppmip7amsIyhrKyakaOxbq7Osp2roZWjsW63yJ2qZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2egpKK5</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dallas-megachurch-christmas-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Texas megachurch is slammed for extravagant Christmas service with 1,000-strong cast, live camels an</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miranda-lambert-texas-medal-of-arts-award-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miranda Lambert Accepts Texas Medal of Arts Award</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
