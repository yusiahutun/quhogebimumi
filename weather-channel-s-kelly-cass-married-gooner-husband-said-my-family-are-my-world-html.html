Let’s find out.</p><h2>The Married life of Kelly Cass and her Husband:</h2><p>Kelly Cass is a married woman as we all know, but it is her husband who is a mysterious man to all. Well, that is about to change because we are aware who he is. Kelly Cass is married to Chris Bee, @goonerchrisbee. The date of which&nbsp;the couple got married has&nbsp;not been disclosed yet.</p><p>Chris Bee works as Area Sales Representative for Dennison Trailers-South East. Prior working at Dennison Trailers, Chris worked at Ambassador Lift Trucks as a business development manager/customer support manager. Chris is also a goner, a word which is often used to represent Arsenal Football team fans.</p><p>However, he describes himself in his way. In his Twitter info bar, he describes himself as,</p><p>“Proud Dennison Trailer Employee /Sales South East Huge Gooner My Family are my World.”</p><h2>Kelly Cass’s Children:</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-191 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The couples are blessed with three children. Before their third child was born, there were talks about if Kelly was pregnant again, which later came out to be true as Chris verified it with his Twitter post saying,</p><p>“Another Gooner is on their way.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>well its official another little Gooner is on their way in april <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#Happy</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/TeBcIiWATa</a> — chris bee (@goonerchrisbee) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">September 24, 2013</a></p><h2>The happy Gooner Family:</h2><p dir=ltr lang=en>Ok the BEE household I ready could of gone to pub but happy to watch with my family <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#AFC</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#FACUP</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/BdbteEqslF</a> — chris bee (@goonerchrisbee) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 30, 2015</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Among her three children, her daughter has a pet guinea pig which she got after she kept her room clean and her grades steadily good.</p><p>Apart from a guinea pig, the family also has a dog which they rescued. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-192 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>We think&nbsp;the family is pretty attached to animals. So, moving along, there is no news available about any serious conflict that could drag their relationship to the doors of divorce. Kelly Cass is living happily with her loving husband and three children. We can as well call them the ‘gooner family.'</p><h2>Kelly Cass's career achievements</h2><p>Weather Channel's icon Kelly Cass has worked as Metereologist for almost two decades.
