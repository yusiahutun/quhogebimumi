He bought seven acres of land from four different owners on Cape Romano and decided to build a home that was completely self-sufficient.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He was a very smart man. He came up with the actual system, the cistern to collect the water. Also the shape so there'd be no sharp corners for the wind to catch on,' Reilly said.

While the family lived in Louisiana and Mississippi due to Lee's oil work, Maples said Gatlinburg, Tennessee was home.
