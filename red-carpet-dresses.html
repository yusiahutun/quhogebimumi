The way she pulls off the color is, of course, what made it so memorable—most people don’t look this smoking hot in chartreuse. Studying it now, though, I’m struck by the fantastical details, like the embroidered flowers and the mink lining. The shape is very ‘90s, but the embellishments feel like they’re from a fairy tale.

Even people who don't love fashion or red carpets or Björk know about the swan dress. It's one of those fashion references that can unite us all, and I know this as fact because every time I tell someone my dog is named Björk, they ask if she owns a swan dress (she does).</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To me, the swan dress just proves how powerful fashion can be. Björk clearly wore it as an act of rebellion; she was never trying to blend into the sea of Armani gowns. It's refreshing to see someone so sure of their personal style and sense of self that they feel comfortable wearing something so bold on one of the biggest fashion stages.

But the piece de resistance is the red fox fur jacket that Hutton threw on top on her way in. It doesn't seem like it should work: auburn and pastels? But the strangeness of it makes it look even more naturalistic. She really looks like she styled herself, with no interlocutor helping her look so picture perfect.

The deep V is sexy, too, but the most sultry aspect to me is the silver Maltese cross, made better by the mixed metal styling of her stack of gold bangles. I also adore the red nails and matching red lip, which further takes this look into a goth-esque territory the Oscars red carpet isn't particularly known for.
