But some, such as being disorganised, constantly late or procrastinating, could affect others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/936d38c6-1cbb-11ea-8971-922fdc94075f_1320x770_112410.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the worst relationship habits is being overly jealous and possessive combined with being extremely controlling, warns Sara Tang, a sex educator and coach, and founder of Sarasense, a relationship consultancy. “The worst part is mistaking this for a sign of love,” she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/fdd82342-1cbb-11ea-8971-922fdc94075f_1320x770_112410.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having constant conflict with your partner in the form of nagging, arguing, or bickering could be equally damaging to your relationship and sex life. But if a couple don’t ever fight, that’s not healthy either, Tang adds. “It could also mean you’re avoiding conflict, swallowing your feelings and letting resentment build.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fights and arguments are inevitable in any relationship, but when they happen, you must remember not to show contempt or verbally attack your partner with phrases like “you always …” or “you never…”. Instead, try to focus on resolving the problem as a team, she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/fff003a2-1cbb-11ea-8971-922fdc94075f_1320x770_112410.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Passive habits such as laziness and complacency can lead to reluctance to make sex a priority in a relationship. New parents, who are strung out from taking care of a newborn, need to make time to connect with each other. Couples should also avoid falling into a routine or spending too much time together; this is because being together all the time can smother desire and passion. As the old saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Those who have been in a committed relationship for a long time should remember not to become too comfortable and let themselves go as a result. For example, not bothering to put in the effort with your appearance or not trying to be interesting and appealing to your partner will very likely cause them to lose interest.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Communicate regularly about your sex life. Couples tend to only talk about sex when things have started to go wrong. But sex should always be a broader, ongoing conversationSara Tang, sex educator and pleasure coach</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other practical approaches include guiding your partner in bed. You can’t expect them to magically be able to read your mind, she advises. “You can do it verbally, saying ‘I would really love it if you …” or “It’s so hot when you….”, or expressing joy through moans, sighs or body movements.” On top of that, you must always remember to listen to your partner and be open to their suggestions for you.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To make it work, both partners really need to want to work together as a team; compromise is one of the cornerstones of a good relationship. And if things still haven’t improved, couples can seek professional help with a trained sex coach or therapist. Remember, there is no shame in using therapy to help you or your relationship improve.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whenever engaged in a serious conversation with your other half, make sure it is without criticism or judgment and try to show vulnerability first. The point is to make the conversation about intimacy and connection as opposed to sexual frequency or performance, Tang says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/13/7d5fab6c-1d57-11ea-8971-922fdc94075f_1320x770_112410.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A simple script could be something like, ‘I’ve noticed we haven’t been connecting as well as we used to sexually. And it’s been making me (show vulnerability) feel lost/lonely/miss you. Would you be open to talking about it’?”, Tang says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Try to establish a bit of a ‘sexy distance’, for example not sleeping in the same bed for a couple of days or changing your sexual routine. We are often focused on orgasm as the goal of sex, tease each other for a few days without letting each other orgasm. See if that increases your longing and desire for each other,” she advises. “Experiment together; I’m a big fan of taking online courses with explicit videos (not porn) to learn new sex skills. Or even going to a couples’ retreat led by trained sex and relationship coaches who help you break down habits and form new ones,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Research says new habits take time to form. At least 21 days is the minimum. If you are trying to change a bad sex habit and replace it with a new positive one, you must do it consistently and repetitively for some time in order for it to stick,” she says. Finally, self-scrutinising is important so that you can check in with yourself to make sure there are no bad sex habits getting out of hand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Do a ‘sex check-in’ every six months because sexual relationships evolve all the time. Ask yourselves, ‘Where are we in our sexual journey? Are we happy with our sex life as a couple? What should we add to it? Is there anything we haven’t talked about?’”, says Tang.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luisa Tam is a correspondent at the Post</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiucilsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaCofKK%2B06KapZ1faH11fZhrb2icn6PBbrDErKurp6lixrDB0WaqnrBdobansYybmJ1lmJavqsDSZp%2Bor12ovbDAjK2fnqU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./64cbcc2e22601d3b3b8b45de-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tragedia en Tepic: Autobs cae a barranco; se reportan 18 muertos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-minogue-fans-left-concerned-cryptic-message.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Minogue fans left concerned after Paul Solomons shares cryptic message</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
