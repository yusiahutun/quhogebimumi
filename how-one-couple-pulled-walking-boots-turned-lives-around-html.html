The consultant told him that there was no cure, only pain relief.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On that summer day in 2013, broke, homeless and dying, Moth clung to his wife in fear, anger and denial.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Logic told them that they should look for work and a place to rent, but the judgment had destroyed their credit rating and the council said they were a low priority for housing unless Moth was going to die within the year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then Raynor spotted an old hikers’ guide on top of a box she had packed. ‘We could just walk?’ she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Together?’ Moth replied.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Always.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So began a long journey of unaccustomed privation and surprising revivification. When they walked out of the home where they had raised their children, Raynor and Moth had just £320 in the bank and £48 a week in tax credits to sustain them.</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/29/22/4AAD25A600000578-0-image-m-71_1522359482334.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>How a flock of sheep healed my broken heart: Shepherdess...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/03/29/22/4AAC5A9D00000578-0-image-m-9_1522358409140.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>WHAT BOOK would actress Ruth Jones take to a desert island?</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=mol-para-with-font>They blew the remaining cash on lightweight rucksacks, a tent and sleeping bags, and hopped on a bus to Minehead.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They planned to keep the budget low by living on boiled noodles, with the occasional chip shop treat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Wild camping is illegal in England and Wales (apart from parts of Dartmoor), so the Winns quickly learned to get their tent up late and pack it all away, without leaving a trace, before the early morning dog walkers arrived to tut.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They soon worked out that they must keep their story to themselves, after realising that fellow hikers only found the long, wild walk inspirational when they believed it was a lifestyle choice.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As soon as they identified the Winns as ‘losers’, people winced and dropped them.</p><img id=i-3ef1d2f5e6f52647 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/05/21/4ADBCC7B00000578-5583421-image-a-18_1522960081141.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Moth and Raynor were offered a home in Cornwall towards the end of their journey (file image)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Moth and Raynor were offered a home in Cornwall towards the end of their journey (file image)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition to finding themselves on the wrong side of the social tracks, the Winns discovered that daily hiking in your 50s is a lot harder than you remember it was in your 20s.
