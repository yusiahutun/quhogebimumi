Not only for the hype leading up to the momentous occasion, but for the flawless fashion and beauty moments that followed. That Givenchy wedding dress; the 16-foot veil; her soft makeup with the perfect paired-down lip.</p><p>Our favorite aspect of her regal look was that barely-there pout that allowed her natural radiance to shine through. Dior tells <i>InStyle</i> that her makeup artist and close friend, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daniel Martin</a>, used Dior Addict Lip Glow for the big day. It's a color-reviving lip balm that changes hue according to the pH of your skin, and it gave Markle a soft, dewy tint of color for her big day.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hailey-bieber></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Hailey Bieber</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hailey Bieber's no-makeup makeup for her wedding day included a soft pink lip. "We kept her skin really light and allowed her natural glow to shine through, with a little bit of light contour to define her perfect bone structure and bronzy tones on the eyes," makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Denika Bedrossian</a> tells <i>InStyle. "</i>We left her lips really neutral, using a taupe-based nude to line them and a soft peachy lip gloss to add moisture and shine."</p><p>While Bedrossian was tight-lipped about the exact products she used, we suggest Gucci Long Lasting Bold Lip Liner in Nude followed by Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment to recreate Bieber's stunning smile.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-amal-clooney></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Amal Clooney</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Amal Clooney's mesmerizing wedding makeup was flawlessly applied by none other than celebrity makeup artist and founder of her eponymous beauty brand, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Charlotte Tilbury</a>. To achieve Amal's chic berry lips for her Lake Como vows, Tilbury tells <i>InStyle</i> that she used a layered technique, beginning with Lip Cheat Lip Liner in Pillow Talk, a swipe of Matte Revolution in Walk of No Shame, followed by M.I. KISS Lipstick over that. Her rosebud lips were "full of luscious, healthy-looking color," she adds of the iconic wedding look.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kourtney-kardashian></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kourtney Kardashian</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kravis' Portofino wedding was one of the biggest celeb events of the year, with nonstop parties, vintage gowns, and famous guests. But it was Kourtney Kardashian's gothic-glam beauty looks we especially loved, which were a bit bolder and more playful for the reality star. Her makeup artist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Leah Darcy</a>, tells <i>InStyle</i> that the inspiration for her Italian ceremony was "soft contoured liner with a subtle hint of pink velvet finish for a fresh, feminine look." To recreate Kourt's lip, she says to apply Make Up For Ever's Artist Color Pencil in Anywhere Caffeine, followed by Hourglass Cosmetics Velvet Story Lip Cream in Touch, a pinky beige with a soft matte finish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gabrielle-union></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gabrielle Union</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When recalling Gabrielle Union's 2014 wedding to Dwyane Wade, celebrity makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Malika James</a> tells <i>InStyle</i> that the actress wanted her wedding makeup to be timeless. "My goal was to focus on how beautiful her skin is and highlight certain areas that the light would naturally hit," she shares.</p><p>Since Union wed on a steamy day in Florida, James kept the lips low maintenance so she didn't have to worry about them later on. "She was going to have a big kiss, so I applied CrÃ¨me de la Mer The Lip Balm, MAC Lip Pencil in Cork, a little concealer in the center of the lips â€” MAC Pro Longwear Concealer NC45 â€” and a light pink lip gloss â€” NARS Turkish Delight â€” on top."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jasmine-tookes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jasmine Tookes</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Darcy was also the mastermind talent behind this Victoria's Secret model's wedding look. For Tookes, Darcy channeled Naomi Campbell's '90s-inspired lip for a sultry, matte look. "I used Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil in Limitless Brown, plus Pat McGrath Labs LiquiLUST Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in Divine Nude," she tells <i>InStyle</i>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Best Engagement Ring Style for Every Zodiac Sign</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nicola-peltz></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nicola Peltz</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Nicola's lipstick for her wedding was somewhat in keeping with our '90s supermodel references â€” think Claudia Schiffer â€” but we went a little peachier in shade to allow for both color and black and white photos," Peltz's makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kate Lee</a> tells <i>InStyle</i> of her star-studded wedding to Brooklyn Beckham. "The shade we chose together was a combination of a lip liner: CHANEL Lip Liner in 156 Beige Naturel, and an ultra-hydrating lip color: CHANEL Rouge Coco Flash in 116 Easy, applied straight from the bullet and padded with my finger." Lee then blotted just once with a paper and applied one more layer of lip color with a brush for precision and staying power.</p><p>Pro tip: When it comes to nailing the defined lip, Lee recommends tracing the natural lip line, then using a lip brush like Les Pinceaux De CHANEL Dual-Ended Lip Brush NÂ°300 to work in the shade in.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sofia-vergara></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sofia Vergara</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celebrities, they're just like us! Sofia Vergara is a prime example of this, considering she only used drugstore products for her wedding day look, which was classic Sofia: a mix of sexy, bold, and glamorous. CoverGirl confirmed to <i>InStyle</i> that the "Modern Family" star used its Outlast Longwear Lipstick in the shade "Sofia in Love." Unfortunately, this was a custom-made shade of dark red made specifically for the wedding, so it's not available for purchase. However, shades Plumberry and Red Hot are close copies.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-britney-spears></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Britney Spears</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the Queen of Pop's long-awaited nuptials to Sam Asghari, she tapped celebrity makeup team Charlotte Tilbury and her niece Sofia to do her look. "We created a glowy, dreamy, flattering day-to-night look that worked with her dress changes â€” starting with beautifully radiant skin, adding a soft smoky eye, peachy cheeks and of course, the perfect nude-pink bridal lip," Tilbury tells <i>InStyle</i>.</p><p>On Britney's wedding day, Tilbury brought Charlotte's glowing vision to life, using the brand's Pillow Talk trifecta: liner, lipstick, and gloss. First she lined her lips with Lip Cheat in Pillow Talk, then applied Matte Revolution Lipstick in Pillow Talk, and finally, a glossy layer of Collagen Lip Bath in Pillow Talk for a fuller-looking pout.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-paris-hilton></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Paris Hilton</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We wouldn't expect anything besides over-the-top glam from Paris Hilston for a 3-day wedding affair â€” and that's exactly what she went with: contorred cheekbones, mega lashes, and glossy pink lips. Hilton shared her wedding day beauty routine on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>her blog</a>, along with the products her makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Steven Tabimba</a> used. "The look was very classic," explains Tabimba. "And heavily inspired by Marilyn Monroe."</p><p>He kept the skin matte and velvety, with completely matte eyes channeling Monroe's signature style, but saved the best for last: the lip. "While too much gloss wouldn't have worked for that first kiss, there's still a touch of shine," he adds. To copy her pretty-in-pink pout, apply MAC Lip Liner in Spice to keep the color in place, then top it off with MAC's Viva Glam II Lipstick for a satiny mauve finish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-josephine-skriver></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Josephine Skriver</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Victoria's Secret model also called upon Leah Darcy for her wedding to singer-songwriter Bohnes in Mexico this past April. Darcy tells <i>InStyle </i>the inspiration for Skriver's bridal beauty was "glowed-up skin look with a plump, yet contoured lip."</p><p>This happens to be one of our favorite looks for boho or beachy brides and to recreate it, you only need two products. First Darcy paired the Makeup By Mario Ultra Suede Sculpting Lip Pencil in Toasty around her lips and to fill them in, then she followed that up with Dior Addict Lip Maximizer in Rosewood for a volume-packed, brownish-pink pout that was equal parts sultry and romantic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLmqvNJomp6klZe%2FqsDYZq6enJSeu6h5y6KnrKyZmLg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2024-01-17-011724-ginuwine-1760421-498.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ginuwine Hates Sex to His Own Music, Crowns Usher King of R&amp;amp;B</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-foo-fighters-will-help-to-open-i-m-p-s-newest-venue-the-atlantis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>The Foo Fighters Will Help To Open I.M.P.s Newest Venue, The Atlantis</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
