There are doors falling off the hinges, garbage scattered in the streets, and trees falling into houses.&nbsp; &nbsp; Stevenson says the unlivable conditions in this neighborhood add to the violence.&nbsp; &nbsp; “I have a purpose driven,” said Stevenson. “I have a purpose driven ever since my son died in this area. I have a purpose driven you know what I mean to make sure Rock Island is safe any way I can.” &nbsp; For Bester’s family, their main concern is the safety of kids passing by the houses on their way to and from school.&nbsp; &nbsp; “We don’t want to see somebody else go through what we’ve been through,” said Leann Quinn, De-Mar’s sister-in-law.&nbsp; &nbsp; “It’s not safe for children,” said Stevenson. “It’s hazardous for children to even walk past. There’s doors hanging, there’s broken windows, we need to do something about these houses.” &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Although Stevenson lives in Missouri, she makes the more than four hour drive once a month to meet with Rock Island city officials.&nbsp; &nbsp; “Let’s tear down, let’s rebuild, and let’s start keeping the kids in this community safe,” said Stevenson. &nbsp; For Bester’s family, while they’re constantly reminded of their loss, it’s De-Mar’s legacy that keeps them going.&nbsp; &nbsp; “I know he’s happy, I know he’s proud. I know he would do the same thing for one of us,” said Sheen Gray, De-Mar’s oldest sister.&nbsp; &nbsp; “Lets start showing that we care,” said Stevenson. “Lets start bringing the love back that we need to bring back in this community. You know what I mean? So we won’t be divided, let’s all come together and do something about these situations.” &nbsp; The Rock Island Police Department has started installing security cameras and street lights and plan to add more in the near future.&nbsp; &nbsp; Stevenson plans to continue to meet with Rock Island city officials about tearing down the abandoned houses, but no official plans have been made at this time.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46mpq2glad6p7XGoausZZakv26%2FwJ%2Bcq2WemraotMGoqaGnn5l8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./princess-anne-wears-embroidered-mini-dress-garden-party-queens-pearls.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Princess Anne looks ultra glamorous in embroidered dress and her favourite jewels</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jane-seymour-has-never-been-happier-since-meeting-boyfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jane Seymour Has Never Been Happier Since Falling in Love With Boyfriend John Zambetti</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
