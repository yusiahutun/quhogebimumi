One person who recently departed is <a href=#>Emme Rylan</a>, who plays the legacy character Lulu Spencer.</p><p id=par-2_40>However, Lulu was not killed off, so it’s possible she might return in the future. Some fans think Lulu could make an appearance again when her ex-husband, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna), start dating her best friend, Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emme-Rylan-General-Hospital.jpg><h2>Lulu left Port Charles after sustaining injuries during an explosion</h2><p id=par-3_52>In late November, Lulu sustained serious injuries after getting caught in an explosion. She was at the Floating Rib when Julian Jerome (<a href=#>William deVry</a>) planted a bomb there and blew the bar up. Initially, Lulu didn’t seem to be seriously harmed. However, after she was taken to the hospital, she suddenly collapsed.</p><p id=par-4_49>It was then revealed that Lulu had sustained a brain injury. She became comatose, and her family members decided it was best to transfer her to a long-term care facility in New York City. As a result, Lulu is no longer a part of everyday life in Port Charles.</p><h2>Emme Rylan is no longer working on ‘General Hospital’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_59>Lulu’s departure coincided with actor Emme Rylan’s own <a href=#>departure</a> from General Hospital. In late October, Rylan shared the news that she would no longer be working on the soap opera. She revealed that the house she and her family were living in had been sold by their landlord, and they would now be embarking on a road trip together.</p><p id=par-6_91>There are rumors that General Hospital let Rylan go due to budget cuts. However, Rylan has not spoken much about these rumors aside from a post she made on Instagram story. She wrote, “I am getting a lot of questions that I cannot answer …&nbsp; people are kind of being confused that maybe I chose to take a vacation or take time-off,&nbsp; so the only thing I can say is ‘no, I did not choose this.’&nbsp; I can’t say anything else. There you go. That’s all I am allowed to say.”</p><h2>Fans think Lulu could return when Dante and Maxie get together</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_23>Because Lulu did not die, it is possible she could return to Port Charles sometime in the future with another actor portraying her.</p><p id=par-8_20>On <a href=#>Reddit</a>, a number of fans believe the show could have Lulu come back when Dante and Maxie get together.</p><p id=par-9_47>“Lulu will wake up just as soon as Dante falls in love or gets someone pregnant. It will be about a year,” one person wrote. “Unless the other woman is Maxie in which case love isn’t necessary, a one night stand will suffice to wake Lulu up.”</p><p id=par-10_66>Another fan also thinks bringing Lulu’s boyfriend Dustin (Mark Lawson) back after he reportedly died during the Floating Rib explosion could start a lot of drama as well. The fan said, “Lulu will be back when Dante & Maxie get back together OR when it’s revealed that Dustin did not die and is helping Brook Lynn raise her baby with Valentine. Whatever brings the most drama.”</p><p id=par-11_57>In any case, the big question is: Will Dante and Maxie even get together? The two of them did have a few bonding moments after Dante returned to Port Charles a few months ago. However, Maxie is pregnant with Peter August’s (Wes Ramsey) child, and the two of them seem committed to creating a happy family together.</p><p id=par-12_38>Of course, General Hospital is known for keeping fans on their toes with its many twists and turns. It’s not always easy to predict what will happen, so viewers should tune to see how the characters’ lives unfold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0prrEq5ilZZikwLG105qjZp6Ro8BuwMeipaRlnKq5tnnWoqOlZaKawba%2BzWauoZ2eYrGiutOeZJqmlGK6osTInmSgnaRiwbCzxK2fnqpencGuuI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./us-slaps-sanctions-33-chinese-companies-and-institutions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>US slaps sanctions on 33 Chinese companies and institutions, dialling up the tension amid the lowest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./504827-90-lines-propose-a-girl-a-sweet-romantic-way.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>90+ best lines to propose to a girl in a sweet and romantic way</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
