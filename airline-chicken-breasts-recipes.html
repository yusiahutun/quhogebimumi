However, as any home chef knows, they’re super easy to overcook, leaving you with dried-out meat that’s less than appetizing. That’s why we were intrigued to learn about “airline chicken” (which is also known as “airline chicken cut”). The quirky-named chicken cut consists of a boneless breast with a drumette still attached. The combo ends ups juicier and more tender than other poultry cuts. It’s a favorite among professional chefs, but you can get your hands on it too (without the restaurant prices) and turn dinner into an extra special treat. Here’s the scoop on airline chicken breasts, the best ways to cook them, plus easy recipes ready in just an hour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is airline chicken breast?</h2><p>Airline chicken breasts are boneless with the skin on and bone-in drumette attached. Since it’s a specialty cut, you’re more likely find it in a butcher shop instead of your grocery store’s meat aisle — that said, some supermarket meat counters will cut airline chicken on request. Airline chicken also tends to be a bit pricier than standard chicken breasts. For instance, Farmingdale Meat Market in New York sells airline chicken breasts for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$7.89 per pound</a>, while their boneless, skinless chicken breasts cost <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$5.49 per pound</a>. Still, many chefs say it’s worth the extra price since it’s prepared in a way to guarantee flavorful and moist chicken.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why is it called ‘airline’ chicken breast?</h2><p>As the name suggests, this cut of chicken is inspired by airplane food. In fact, a common theory is that it was popularized <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during the 1960s</a> as an in-flight dinner option that could fit perfectly into a tray or dish. It’s certainly not far-fetched that it gained attention during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the golden age of travel</a>. But another explanation for the name relates to how the chicken looks like a plane and one of its wings — as if it’s about to “fly” off of the plate and onto your fork. Who knew a chicken breast could have such a fun name and unique history to go with it!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3 reasons to cook airline chicken breasts&nbsp;</h2><p>The chicken’s appearance and name are a fun draw for many; however, there’s more than what meets the eye. Here are three reasons airline chicken breasts are worth trying if you’re looking for a new way to enjoy poultry.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Airline chicken cut stays super juicy</h3><p>The skin still being on the chicken provides extra moisture to the meat so it doesn’t dry out . Plus, the marrow-filled bone in the drumette also releases moisture and flavor as it cooks. (Click through for more flavor-infused <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bone-in chicken recipes</a>.)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Airline cut chicken is very versatile</h3><p>You don’t need to go searching for a fancy recipe that showcases this chicken’s flavor and texture. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg Burroughs</a>, chef instructor at the <a href=#>Culinary Institute of Virginia</a>, airline chicken breasts are a versatile cut that can be prepared in a variety of ways. “You just sear it, you can bake this, you can stuff it, you can do so many things with it,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he says</a>. Whether you pan-sear, roast or bake this poultry, always dress it up with your favorite herbs and seasonings including this <a href=#>Tuscan heat spice blend</a> for spicy and pungent flavors.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Airline chicken cut is easy to slice and serve</h3><p>Once cooked to juicy perfection, airline chicken breasts are a breeze to cut up and plate — especially if you’re aiming for restaurant-style flair. “I could cut it with the lines of the body, fan it out and put it in a swirl, and that almost makes it like a cone,” Burroughs says.</p><p>In the video below, cooking YouTuber <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Ragusea</a> shows the process of slicing an airline chicken breast at the 7:33 mark for tender meat.
