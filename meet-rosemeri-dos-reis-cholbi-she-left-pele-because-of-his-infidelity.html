He was married three times before his death at the age of 82. Despite his many accomplishments, he was also controversial due to several extramarital affairs.</p><p>Pelé’s first marriage was to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi in the late 1960s. While their union was initially happy, Pelé’s inability to remain faithful separated them. Many fans of the football legend are curious about Rosemeri and where she is today.</p><p>Her life remains shrouded in mystery, but her place in Pelé’s story is a reminder that even the greatest of legends have complex personal lives.</p><p>So, who is Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/322108368_545731554270644_4960548841991324886_n.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Theres_Little_Information_on_Rosemeri_dos_Reis_Cholbi></span>There’s Little Information on Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rosemeri Dos Reis Cholbi may not be a household name like her famous ex-husband Pelé, but she played a significant role in his life as one of his three wives. At 80, she has likely led a fascinating life, but little is known about her upbringing or family history.</p><p>We know that she was married to Pelé in the late 1960s, during the height of his football career, and that their union was not without its share of controversy.&nbsp;Despite being married to one of the most successful and popular sports stars of the 20th century, Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi has managed to maintain a relatively low profile. As a result, people wonder about her life beyond her famous husband.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Rosemeri_Dos_Reis_Cholbi_Have_Kids></span>Did Rosemeri Dos Reis Cholbi Have Kids?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Pelé welcomed three children together. Their first son, Edson, was born in 1970, while their third child, Jennifer, was born in 1978. The couple’s second child was a daughter named Kelly Cristina Nascimento. So, yes, Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi did have kids with Pelé.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rosemeris_Failed_Marriage_With_Pele></span>Rosemeri’s Failed Marriage With Pelé<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pelé met and fell in love with Rosemeri while he was in Brazil. They got married in 1966. Despite having three children together, Pelé admitted to being unfaithful in their marriage and having many affairs. In his <a href=#>Netflix documentary</a>, he revealed that he was “too young” for the wedding and that his first wife knew about his infidelity.&nbsp;</p><p>Pelé claimed that commercial deals allowed him to travel, and it was during these travels that he had relationships with other women. He acknowledged having fathered children outside of their marriage and didn’t know how many. Pelé said that he and Rosemeri had no “madly in love” passion and only had a friendship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/962e465dc6bbc3ac68abadee92f7dd5f.jpg><p>Pelé split with Rosemeri and moved to New York with their three children. Rosemeri ended things with Pelé finally in 1982.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Controversial_Life_of_Pele></span>The Controversial Life of Pelé<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pelé’s controversial past doesn’t end with his infidelity towards his first wife. In 1964, he had a relationship with a maid named Anizia Machado. However, for decades, the sport legend denied having fathered her child, Sandra Regina Machado. Sandra had to face a long legal battle to prove her paternity. It wasn’t until 1998 that Pelé finally recognized her as his daughter through DNA testing.</p><p>Unfortunately, Sandra was never compensated for growing up without the same benefits as Pelé’s other six children. She died in 2006 without ever receiving the acknowledgment or support she deserved. While this is not the only controversy in Pelé’s life, it sheds light on a dark chapter in his past.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Death_of_Rosemeri_Dos_Reis_Cholbis_Husband_Pele></span>The Death of Rosemeri Dos Reis Cholbi’s Husband, Pelé<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pelé’s health became a concern after reports emerged that he had been admitted to a hospital in Sao Paulo with general swelling. It was later revealed that he was undergoing a re-evaluation of his chemotherapy treatment. The legendary footballer had been diagnosed with colon cancer in September 2021 and had undergone surgery to remove the tumor.&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite the treatment, his health continued to deteriorate. Fans worldwide, especially in Brazil and Qatar, supported Pelé with banners and messages wishing him a speedy recovery.</p><p>Qatar displayed a picture of him, hoping for his quick return to health. Pelé was grateful for the outpouring of support. He took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to thank everyone who had sent him good wishes.</p><p>Sadly, Pelé passed away on December 29, 2022. His passing left a deep void in the hearts of football fans worldwide who had grown up idolizing him. Pelé may be gone, but his legacy will continue to inspire future generations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3f78fa1dc777e8c09d5fd8c0bb3d39d9.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Rosemeri_Still_Alive_Today></span>Is Rosemeri Still Alive Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although there is little information about Rosemeri since her separation from Pelé, it was confirmed after his death that she is alive and living in Brazil.</p><p>Another marriage that ended due to infidelity and unhealthy habits was that of <a href=#>Clarence Thomas</a> and his first wife, Kathy Thomas. The renowned Supreme Court judge had several affairs while married to Kathy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02apqKuVorKztYydpqxlopq2tHnCoaalmpliwKmxjKWcn6xdpbKtsYybnJyZpaiybrvFZp%2Biq12eu6e1w56joqypZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paris-hilton-yeezy-season-6-campaign.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paris Hilton Is a Kim Kardashian Clone for the Yeezy Season 6 Campaign</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jessie-james-decker-flaunts-chest-revealing-treated-new-boobies-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jessie James Decker flaunts her full chest after revealing she 'treated' herself to 'new boobies'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
