At its core, Plex is all about giving you an easy way to access your favorite media—aggregating all your TV shows and movies into a single unified location. Plex can be run directly off your laptop or desktop, but if you're looking to create a more robust setup, picking up a NAS (network-attached storage) device is essential.</p><p>Not all NAS devices are up to the task of hosting your Plex server. That means you'll need to be careful about which ones you pick. To make things easy, you can simply check out the massive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NAS database</a> put together by Plex. Using this, you can hone in on which products support which features.</p><p>Ideally, you'll want something with <a href=#>hardware-accelerated transcoding</a>. This allows the device to stream media without stuttering or lagging. Different devices support different levels of hardware-accelerated transcoding, with some capable of offering the service for 4K footage, while others only support up to 1080p footage. Whatever the case, be sure to pay attention to this when picking up a device.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You'll also want to pay attention to its RAM and number of bays. The more RAM you have, the better it can handle all your data. And the more bays you have, the more options you'll have for expansion. It's also important to consider built-in ports (such as HDMI and GbE), allowing you to quickly output to different devices or connect to an existing system.</p><p>Other factors to weigh include warranties and backup software, though most NAS devices nowadays are adequate on both accounts. But if you're nervous about losing your data, take a closer look at these to ensure you have the proper coverage.</p><p>To help you sift through the hundreds of options, here's a look at the best NAS devices for Plex. These run the gamut from affordable, entry-level devices to ultra-premium products designed for enthusiasts. They also span PC and Mac, ensuring there's a NAS setup for you regardless of your rig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-nas-for-plex-overall-asustor-as5202t>Best NAS for Plex Overall: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Asustor AS5202T</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/terramaster-lifestyle-1.jpg><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Pros</p></td><td><p>Cons</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Certified compatibility with Plex</p></td><td><p>Plex Pass required for most features</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Supports 4K footage</p></td><td><p>Aggressive "gamer aesthetic"</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>HDMI output</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Expandable RAM</p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It looks a bit quirky compared to other NAS devices, but the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Asustor AS5202T</a> is perfect for Plex.

It's also a key feature to look for in NAS devices for Plex, as it ensures you'll get smooth playback when streaming your content. You'll need a Plex Pass subscription to make full use of it—though there's a good chance anyone looking for a NAS for Plex is already a member.</p><p>The AS5202T also benefits from 4K HDR support, an HDMI output so you can quickly connect to a display, and expandable RAM if you ever want to ramp up its performance. And while the two-bay version will suffice for most users, folks with a massive library can spring for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">four-bay unit</a> (though it's quite a bit more expensive).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All told, you're not likely to find a NAS device for Plex that offers the same combination of affordability and power that you'll get with the Asustor AS5202T.
