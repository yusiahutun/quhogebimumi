Her first experience in television was a positive one.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6lA0byrdWn data-wc=70>“That show will always hold such a&nbsp;special place in my heart. We had an incredible cast and crew, every single person was so lovely and you could tell they all genuinely wanted to be there and make the show the best it could be. Children’s television was such a joy because&nbsp;it doesn’t take itself seriously. It was fun and silly – a really good vibe in the room.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/5ca02362bd12-230718-hello-s01-139-copy.jpg><p id=eCz-8NO441N data-wc=43>Although comedy was a gateway into acting, and she is undeniably very funny, there are many more layers to her talents. Her first acting role to follow was playing Ursula Pole in the Starz historical drama .</p><p id=ebBovq1BxOg data-wc=45>Next, Amelia was cast for the role of Anne Brontë in Frances O’Connor’s biographical film , her first movie. “That was an&nbsp;interesting experience,” she smiles. “I was still&nbsp;getting used to the dynamics of film-making and I made sure I took it all in.”</p><p id=eBCorgBjnC5 data-wc=73>Growing up in Barking, London, Amelia was introduced to , as both her parents are fans. “We still quote them a lot… you know, the classic, ‘Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries’,” she blurts out in character. “It’s a quirky, funny humour, but also so stupid. And it kind of revels in the fact that it’s silly and I love that they don’t take themselves too seriously.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ff58ef1cc534-230718-hello-s05-062-copy.jpg><p id=eBxlnvA9S8n data-wc=56>More recently, Amelia became obsessed with . “I love Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt – and in that show specifically. The humour is so niche and quirky and that’s the kind I like. I don’t always laugh at the standard American sitcom. I find the oddest things funny. And that show just encapsulates odd.”</p><p id=eNaf4NnF453 data-wc=53>Amelia is also a writer and, alongside acting, it is something she would like to explore further. “I would really love to delve more into&nbsp;writing, and not necessarily comedy or children’s,&nbsp;but different genres. My main thing is writing stories around characters I feel passionate about and going in-depth into their worlds.”</p><p id=eJWp_DjjKTl data-wc=43>Her multifaceted skill-set has led to Amelia to&nbsp;be likened to actress, screenwriter and producer Phoebe Waller-Bridge. “I admire Phoebe’s work, she’s a great talent.

And in the cover shoot she’s wearing Dior, a brand she has a growing relationship with. “Dior and I… it’s a really nice rapport,” she smiles.&nbsp;</p><p id=esYHh41YtGH data-wc=42>“They are very kind and generous by inviting&nbsp;me to their catwalk shows. It’s such a nice experience stepping into the world of fashion, going to Paris Fashion Week, seeing the shows and beautiful clothing. I feel very honoured to&nbsp;be involved.</p><p id=eGWDG7KKGyA data-wc=76>“I’m still working out my wardrobe and what my style is, so it’s great to work with Dior and see all of their amazing looks and wear them for events and in this magazine.
