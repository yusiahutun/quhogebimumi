The <a href=#>royal</a> feud between the siblings has been rumbling on for some time. <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> even spoke about the distance he feels with his older brother in his memoir Spare earlier this year. In the bombshell autobiography he called the heir to the throne his ‘arch-nemesis’. Now, Moir says William isn’t on talking terms with the Duke.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-refusing-to-talk-to-harry>Prince William ‘refusing to talk to Harry’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-951562018-1024x657.jpg><p>Jan Moir <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a>: “The walls between the brothers are now so high that apparently William refuses to even ‘properly talk’ with Harry, while Harry is still moping about, seeking ‘an apology or accountability’.</p><p>“From William to him, rather than the other way around.”</p><p>This claim comes ahead of the release of a new royal biography by Omid Scobie. He told People that “absolutely nothing has changed” between the brothers.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘angry’ over William and Kate being well-liked</a></p><p>Omid, who has been called a close friend of the Sussexes by royal experts, said: “I saw Harry’s release of&nbsp;Spare&nbsp;as his last attempt at telling his family how he’s felt for years. Because clearly there’s never been an open enough forum to have these conversations or share these feelings.”</p><p>Scobie’s new bombshell book has been highly debated within sources and commentators of The Firm. The author penned an unofficial biography of Harry and Meghan after their wedding, called Finding Freedom. At the time, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and Harry denied any connection to the book. However, in the Duchess’ lawsuit against Associated Newspapers last year, the royal had to apologize after a former aide’s emails were released as evidence.</p><p>The messages showed that while Harry and Meghan did not meet up with the authors in person, or directly relay what information they wanted in the book, the couple gave the information to Jason Knauf, their former aide.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-s-phone-calls-were-ignored>Prince Harry’s ‘phone calls were ignored’</h2><p>This follows Scobie’s claim that William <a href=#>ignored calls from Harry</a> as the former Queen lay on her deathbed.</p><p>At the time of her death, she was said to be with Princess Anne and <a href=#>King Charles</a>. Grant Harrold, a former royal butler, suggests that there is a possibility that <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II </a>may have died before Harry was able to get to Balmoral in Scotland.</p><p>Harrold says this might be the simple reason for his inability to see his grandmother before she passed, rather than the ignored calls claim. However, he did say: “We’ll never know what went on.”</p><p>It has also been alleged Harry’s wife Meghan, who was also in London at the time of the late Queen’s death, was not allowed to come.</p><p>“It’s possible they’ve had a discussion about it, but you never really know do you?” he said.</p><p>Harry has made this claim too in his memoir, saying Charles told him <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> wasn’t coming to Balmoral either, as a way to soften the blow.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-relish-in-royal-drama>Meghan and Harry ‘relish’ in royal drama</h2><p>It comes after Angela Levin, a royal biographer, appeared on GB News to give her two cents. Levin said she thinks <a href=#>the pair “relish” in drama</a> and “victimhood.”</p><p>She explained, however, she believes Meghan’s agency has told the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> actress and Harry to pull back on playing the victim card and instead use other methods to get their “message” across.</p><p>“I think it’s a trick,” she explained.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince Harry wants to reap the ‘benefits of being a royal without the work’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aFcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZqqVm8K0tc2gZK2nXamurbeMraZmoJGnv7p51qGmZqGjYsC1tculZKanoJ67qHnAq6auppRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./south-central-regional-medical-center-celebrates-reopening-and-renovation-of-the-third-floor-west-wing.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>South Central Regional Medical Center Celebrates Reopening and Renovation of the Third Floor West Wi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./man-accused-beating-atlanta-woman-met-hinge-dating-app-arrested-new-york-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Man accused of beating Atlanta woman he met on Hinge dating app arrested in New York</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
