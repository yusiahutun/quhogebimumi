It also has the added benefits of relaxation and stress relief, which can very often have adverse effects on the skin,” says <a href=# rel=noopener>Rebecca Elsdon</a>, skin specialist and skincare expert for <a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">The Body Shop</a>. “It’s also great for stimulating blood and lymphatic circulation, improving overall skin health.” It can even improve concentration and combat headaches, migraines, hormonal imbalances and fatigue.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What exactly is face yoga?</h2><p>Face yoga is a series of facial exercises intended to lift, tone and activate your facial muscles to achieve a natural, more youthful look and improve your skin’s appearance. “Just like we train our bodies, we should also train our face muscles. Face yoga stimulates and enhances blood flow, which increases collagen and elastin production, resulting in tighter and plumper skin,” attests face yoga expert and founder of YoGlow Face Yoga <a href=# rel=noopener>Kristin Linderman</a>.&nbsp;While the origins of face yoga are unclear, some say it can be traced back to ancient Chinese and Japanese medicine or the Indian practice of Ayurveda. People began a tradition known as Hatha yoga as far back as 5000 BC, and it is said to have included poses for the face.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>This Simple Jaw Massage May Ward Off Your Tension Headaches and Migraines</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The benefits of face yoga exercises</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Face yoga minimizes lines and wrinkles&nbsp;</h3><p>While dermatologists are on the fence regarding the efficacy of facial exercises, those who practice it say it works. “It has been proven to lift, tighten, smooth and tone skin,” attests Linderman.&nbsp; In fact, a 2018 study published in JAMA Dermatology found that a 30-minute daily or alternate-day facial exercise program helped improve the facial appearance of women ages 40 to 65, <a href=# rel=noopener>resulting in fuller cheeks and a younger appearance</a>.&nbsp;After performing 32 different facial exercises a day over 20 weeks, the middle-aged women looked an average of three years younger.</p><p>“There is some evidence that facial exercises may improve facial appearance and reduce some visible signs of aging,” said lead author <a href=# rel=noopener>Murad Alam, MD,</a> in a press release. “The exercises enlarge and strengthen the facial muscles, <a href=# rel=noopener>so the face becomes firmer and more toned, and shaped like a younger face</a>.”</p><p>Plus, since the body’s collagen production (the protein made up of essential amino acids that give our skin its elasticity and structure, helping to keep it smooth and supple) decreases as we age, leading to sagging skin, wrinkles and fine lines. Doing face yoga exercises regularly can increase circulation in the skin, kickstarting collagen production naturally.&nbsp;(Click through to learn how yoga can ease <a href=#>carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, too.)</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Collagen for Women: Adding It To Your Smoothie May Make Skin Look Years Younger</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Facial yoga plumps up the cheeks and lips</h3><p>Forget fillers, say experts, you can pose your way into plumper cheeks and lips. “The natural lifting and plumping effect it causes minimizes the appearance of lines on your face and neck,” says Linderman.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Face yoga helps the face appear more symmetrical</h3><p>As we age, our face loses volume, and unfortunately, this loss doesn’t always occur evenly — which can result in a lopsided look. “Face yoga helps to strengthen facial muscles and relieve tension in the face to build better symmetry,” explains Linderman.&nbsp;</p><p>Related:<a href=#>Dermatologists Reveal The Best Ways To Fix Droopy Eyelids Without Surgery</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Facial yoga brightens your complexion&nbsp;</h3><p>Regularly doing facial exercises reduces inflammation and puffiness created by stagnant lymph nodes, brightening your skin’s complexion and making you look healthier and more youthful overall.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5 face yoga exercises that will help you look younger&nbsp;</h2><p>If you’re interested in trying out face yoga for yourself, you’ll be happy to know several options are available. We tapped Linderman for the exercises we can do daily.</p><p><strong>Linderman’s how-to:</strong> Do each exercise in 30-second increments or for three repetitions of a 10-second hold. Be sure to drink plenty of water before, after and during this face routine. If you continue this routine for 20 days, you will see an improvement in your skin’s complexion and experience tighter, plumper skin. Perform this daily routine both day and night for faster results.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. For glowing cheeks&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Moisturizer.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Moisturize-Up.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Moisturizer-2.jpg><p>Start with gentle tapping with clean hands along your clean face to stimulate blood flow and spread any serum, oil or moisturizer of your choice. This boosts circulation, brings nutrients and oxygen to the skin surface and relaxes tension under the muscle. It also helps to eliminate any stalled lymph in your face and neck. Be sure to blend any remaining serum or moisturizer in an upward-sweeping motion. Next, you can activate your natural smile lines, hold for 30 seconds and release and reactivate. Do this as long as you would like while taking deep breaths.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. To lift the face&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/O-Face-edited.jpg><p>Linderman says that making this “O” face is a “total facelift” because it activates all 57 facial muscles.&nbsp;To do this, while placing your upper and lower lips over your teeth, smile with the corners of your mouth and lift your cheeks by smiling with your eyes. She suggests doing this move every morning as it boosts energy and clears your mind too.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3.

You can activate your smile lines and let your eyes roll up and back. Taking deep breaths, turn your head to the right and stick your tongue out as if you are trying to touch your nose. When you are ready, you can turn your head to the left and repeat. Hold this for 30 seconds on each side. Repeat if necessary.</p><p>“I find that gently pressing your chin to either side with your fingertips also acts as an excellent <a href=# rel=noopener>vagus nerve</a> reset. The vagus nerve is the longest cranial nerve we have, and it carries information from the brain to many organs in our chest and abdomen and back to the brain,” says Linderman.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>Top Doctors Say Toning Your Vagus Nerve Undoes the Toll Chronic Stress Has Taken on Your Body</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4.

Be sure to keep your shoulders down and your back straight. Take deep breaths and release tension. You can do circular rotations at the back of your jaw to remove inflammation.
