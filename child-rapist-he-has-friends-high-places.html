The 67-year-old tried to wave them off with a copy of a release order, which he claimed was justified by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's grant of executive clemency in April this year, when she reduced his two life sentences to a 16-year term.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jalosjos is now behind bars again - but his case provides a startling insight into a Philippine judicial and political system that never ceases to amaze.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jalosjos' incarceration has already led to the sacking of three jail wardens.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first was sacked for allowing the convict to host a party in the jail, with Jalosjos supplying a roast pig, beer and raffle prizes. The party also featured a pre-teen dancing girl.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A second jail warden was sacked after a fellow prisoner acting as Jalosjos' bodyguard was found in possession of a gun.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The third was sacked on Wednesday for signing Jalosjos' release papers, even though the Bureau of Corrections chief Ricardo Dipat said the release had been approved by presidential executive secretary Eduardo Ermita.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Critics of President Arroyo suggest she still wants to have the powerful Jalosjos freed, and was prevented from doing so this time only by the public outrage. But Arroyo supporters say the fact that Jalosjos is back in jail is proof of where her loyalties lie.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Presidential legal counsel Sergio Apostol said Mrs Arroyo 'has seen that there is a public clamour to deny him clemency, that this is not the right time to release him'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What remains beyond question is that Jalosjos has shown not a trace of remorse for his crimes - raping an 11-year-old girl twice and six counts of lascivious acts. The 1997 trial was a sensational affair, which came only after a 23-day manhunt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The victim had been adopted by a man named Simplicio Delantar, who had sold her for sex to wealthy men since she was five.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She testified that Jalosjos had promised to make her a TV star and gave her lots of money to buy clothes and candy. She described her encounter with Jalosjos in the Ritz Tower in Makati City, where she was instructed by Delantar to call the congressman 'daddy'.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite the girl's damning testimony, Jalosjos continued to enjoy bipartisan support, even after his conviction. Lawmakers refused to expel him from Congress on the grounds that he could still appeal before the Supreme Court.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He did appeal, saying he was 'a victim ... of an 11-year-old experienced sex worker'. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal in 2002.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jalosjos enjoyed the support of at least two presidents. During the trial, Joseph Estrada once confronted prosecutors and demanded to know: 'Why are you persecuting my friend?' Estrada told them their efforts were useless because he would simply give Jalosjos a presidential pardon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mrs Arroyo paid Jalosjos a post-midnight visit in his jail cell in 1997, when she was considering a run for the presidency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jalosjos' brother and sister later joined Mrs Arroyo's political party, Kampi, and helped deliver her victory in the 2004 presidential polls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then in 2005, Mrs Arroyo raised the possibility of releasing Jalosjos, in exchange for his legislative allies approving urgent tax measures.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Justice Secretary Raul Gonzalez said there was 'no question' Jalosjos had well-placed friends. In 1998, Mr Gonzalez himself was among legislators who petitioned for Jalosjos to be allowed to attend legislative sessions after his conviction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Mr Gonzalez said he had no choice last week but to order Jalosjos back to jail - and stay there until at least 2009. 'I really have nothing against Mr Jalosjos personally ... I'm just following the policy of the president,' Mr Gonzalez explained.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Reli German, a former colleague of Jalosjos in the entertainment and advertising industry, speculated that the Arroyo government now had no choice but to keep a valued political ally in jail. 'I don't think they can afford the backlash,' said Mr German, who is now a presidential palace consultant.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He tried to explain why Jalosjos continues to have many backers: 'He's charming, charitable, he's not a stingy person. He's a soft touch - anybody can walk up to him, give him a sad story and he'll do something about it.'</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdmZ35xg5FomqGhnJl6s63PoqqtZZiaeqmt0madq6GVo7G0eceinqFloKGupLHS</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./demian-bichir.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Demian Bichir Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-facts-about-national-receptionists-day-may-8th.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 Facts About National Receptionists Day (May 8th)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
