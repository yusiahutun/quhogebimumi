She was in a relationship with Richie Sambora, another singer.&nbsp;</p><p>The two first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> each other back in 2013 in Hawaii, and things were all smooth sailing from there until 2018.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>So what happened?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Well, by the looks of it, it was a mutual decision.
