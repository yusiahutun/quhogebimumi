His optimism and joy was contagious to everyone he met.&nbsp;He loved life, his family, God and his church.&nbsp;He valued hard work and still found pleasure in going to the office every day. His bright light and smile was memorable to everyone he met. The family wishes for everyone to show their love and celebrate him by wearing bright colors.</p><p>Services will be Saturday, March 25, at First Trinity Presbyterian Church in Laurel.&nbsp; Visitation will be at 10 a.m., and a funeral service will be at 11 a.m..
