No one can define how you should feel,” Chen Craig says. “I’ve never even looked at those articles that are like, ‘Okay, you’re 50 now, you need to do this.’ I still have long hair—it’s bleach blonde. I still wear six-inch heels. I wore a skintight Prada dress to Amina Muaddi’s party with these 20-year-olds. And when they hear my son is going to LMU, they’re like, ‘Wait, we thought maybe you’re saying that you had graduated not long ago from LMU.’ So, it’s all really such a state of mind.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another of the founder’s not-so-secret weapons for a well-lived life? “I’m just having fun,” she says. “I’m more experienced and more mature, of course, and I run two businesses, but who I am and how I feel? I’m the same person inside.” Chen Craig extends her youthful yet well-seasoned mindset to her overall physical well-being, a talent that helps her radiate from the inside out.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We caught up with the skincare expert to learn more about her approach to aging beautifully, and the aspects of her life that make her feel most youthful—in addition to the added zeal that comes with raising a 19-year-old son in the TikTok era.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>If you don’t mind sharing, how old are you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m in my early 50s. I just feel like people define women according to these categories, and I don’t think that it’s necessary. They don’t ever ask that of men, like their achievements aren’t defined by their age, or whether or not they’ve had children. That’s just how I’ve always felt. But you know, it’s fine. I’m in my early 50s.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What age do you feel you are in your head?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I don’t really feel an age. I have friends who are in their 30s and 40s who act way more mature than me. My best friend in the world, Nicky Hilton, is in her 40s, and I always call her for advice. I don’t feel any age, I just feel good. I don’t have an age in my head for myself—but I don’t think I’m 25, I’m not deluded.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you have a holy-grail beauty product you’ve worn for most of your life?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Eye serums and creams. I don’t care what brand, just eye creams in general. When I was 18, my grandmother taught me it’s better to use good products. So at 18 years old, I was at USC, I would save my allowance—not eat at times—to go to Neiman Marcus and buy a La Prairie or Sisley Paris eye cream. I remember being really young, taking off my contact lenses, washing my face, and putting on my eye serum. So, I really believe in them, because the eye area is so much more fragile [than the rest of your face]. And eye creams are specifically formulated for that thinner skin, just like our <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://bluemercury.com/products/u-beauty-the-return-eye-concentrate data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Return Eye Concentrate" data-vars-ga-product-id=c3d8193f-5754-45ba-8b66-069ca866000e data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://bluemercury.com/products/u-beauty-the-return-eye-concentrate data-product-url=https://bluemercury.com/products/u-beauty-the-return-eye-concentrate data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbluemercury.com%2Fproducts%2Fu-beauty-the-return-eye-concentrate" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="U Beauty" data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=db4e13da-9bb1-4d7a-b0cc-79d4da334a93 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="U Beauty" class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Return Eye Concentrate</a>.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">La Prairie Skin Caviar Luxe Eye Cream</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$435 at Nordstrom for Skin Caviar Luxe Eye Cream" data-href=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/5370975 data-product-url=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/5370975 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5370975&u1=har|xid:{xid}" data-affiliate-network='{"id":"e263d99a-3772-4907-9ae8-cde76366d01b","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","is_active":true,"details":null,"metadata":{"trackonomics":{"merchant_id":"689250","merchant_name":"NORDSTROM.com","network_name":"LS","network_id":"4","product_id":"459","product_name":"Harper&#39;s BAZAAR US","product_external_id":"459","product_url":null}},"network":{"id":"a332915a-6423-480f-9153-e3973f438607","name":"Trackonomics","is_active":true,"business_unit_id":"ad046b46-538b-42cb-aa54-c3d158875ed6","details":"","metadata":{},"created_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481570+00:00","last_updated_at":"2021-11-04T18:15:18.481594+00:00"},"product_metadata":{"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5370975&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5370975&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-09-14 03:22:32.233872"},"530bacd4-96b2-4cfe-a9a6-1fbd7c749e22":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5370975&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5370975&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2023-11-15 23:26:27.596038"},"81bbdae2-81fb-4d95-b643-a0679795a2a4":{"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5370975&u1={subid}","network_name":"ls","appended_link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=SyrN4SGJMyU&mid=1237&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nordstrom.com%2Fs%2F5370975&u1={subid}|xid:{xid}","last_updated_at":"2024-02-27 11:58:54.505013"}}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$435 at Nordstrom" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nordstrom.com/s/5370975 data-vars-ga-product-brand="La Prairie" data-vars-ga-product-id=7af9cb0a-2855-45c6-9ede-aad06d2a9367 data-vars-ga-product-price=$435.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=e8307ac5-cc7e-4297-941d-ebe2f68e06f8 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="La Prairie" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=5370975_24848810 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Skin Caviar Luxe Eye Cream" title="Skin Caviar Luxe Eye Cream" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1675099192-bbc119c9-ae7e-42b2-be51-e159a664aba7.jpg width=500 height=767 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">La Prairie Skin Caviar Luxe Eye Cream</h2></p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Credit: Nordstrom</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But that’s the one holy grail I really think that people should consider as they get into their mid-to-late 40s, because this is the time you start seeing the experiences of your well-lived life. And I think <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a27886249/how-to-get-rid-of-laugh-lines/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="laugh lines" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">laugh lines</a> are wonderful: I always tell my doctor, “Don’t get rid of my laugh lines.” Only really young people have laugh lines, because older people get them Botoxed out, so there’s no expression. That’s my trick: I get it around my forehead, but I leave the laugh lines.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>A lot of conversations around aging seem to lead to injectables and plastic surgery. Tell us, what are your thoughts on the topic?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I started trying Botox in my mid-to-late 40s. I never touched my face before then, and I didn’t want to, mainly because I’m from the ’90s and it just wasn't as accessible. Back then they did something called silicone injections, which were permanent, and really scary. When all these injectables came in during the Aughts, I wasn’t part of that movement because I was busy trying to have a baby, and I had difficulty conceiving. So, in my 30s when all this started happening, I wasn’t part of that movement because I was doing in vitro injections.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then in my early 40s, when [my son] turned 10 or 12, I thought, Oh, maybe it’s time. And I interviewed every doctor, I did my own research, and even now, it takes me so long to decide to do something. I never tried lasers until this year and I’m in my 50s! So, whatever you feel like doing, you should do, and not because you think you have to look a certain way. But I saw some things I didn’t like, and I wanted to just improve myself, and feel better about them. I don’t do fillers in my face—I’m very lucky that I have a big round face, I never had to do that—but if women need to do it, go for it.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Can you explain the backstory behind one of your scars or beauty marks?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maybe my hysterectomy? Those tiny little scars on my stomach. I was so lucky—my doctor caught it in pre-cancer stage, and it hadn’t even embedded; but at the time they couldn’t tell, they just knew it was the slowest-growing type. When they do these biopsies, they can tell which kind of cancer it is—fast- or slow-growing—but they can’t tell what stage it is until they perform the biopsy. And when it’s in the uterus, you risk the cancer cells being spread to the cervix or your ovaries. So, because I’d already had my child and I was 48, I just said, You know what, let’s get rid of it all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We did a radical hysterectomy via laparoscopic, so, there were six little scars. It’s the least invasive and easiest on your body, and those scars are barely discernible. I have to really look for them, because I get worried when I don’t see them. I want to constantly remind myself that I’m so lucky to be here and alive—many women don’t have that kind of story, and they had to go through chemo. Mine is: There was no other treatment, just a hysterectomy, and I’ve been fine ever since. It’s almost like when you’re looking at the sky, and you’re looking at a constellation and your favorite star. I think those are the ones that I treasure, because it was life-saving for me.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Which beauty products would you say have aged well?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Our Resurfacing Compound. It’s aged so well, because when I started testing it, oh my gosh, six years ago, my son was barely 13—he’s about to turn 19 next month. And now in college, he has all three sizes in his dorm, and it’s aged with him. Because it’s the world’s first product where we can show you the clinicals, and tell you it’s AI-driven. And I can explain to you why a 13-year old is able to use it, who is now turning 19. And why an 82-year-old uses it, because your skin dictates where the actives are released.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">U Beauty Resurfacing Compound</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Shop at ubeauty.com for Resurfacing Compound" data-href=https://ubeauty.com/products/resurfacing-compound data-product-url=https://ubeauty.com/products/resurfacing-compound data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fubeauty.com%2Fproducts%2Fresurfacing-compound" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shop at ubeauty.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ubeauty.com/products/resurfacing-compound data-vars-ga-product-brand="U Beauty" data-vars-ga-product-id=85080281-a297-4f5f-9dff-0e2750512909 data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=af4ef9df-8982-478d-bdbb-2ff2cae7d70d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Resurfacing Compound" title="Resurfacing Compound" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1701201392-uber-wu1-v1-656645e6b81a2.jpg width=1000 height=1000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">U Beauty Resurfacing Compound</h2></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Our <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ubeauty.com/pages/siren-technology data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="siren capsules" data-vars-ga-product-id=6b2a00d7-291a-43e1-8e8f-74c9e65c04ef data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://ubeauty.com/pages/siren-technology data-product-url=https://ubeauty.com/pages/siren-technology data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fubeauty.com%2Fpages%2Fsiren-technology" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=d30a54f0-267f-4271-83ec-a10ac7427fb5 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">siren capsules</a> mimic a healthy skin cell, so it’s made of the exact same polyunsaturated fatty acid as your own skin. So, that free radical is tricked into thinking it’s a skin cell, so it attacks it, and penetrates through the capsule wall. That’s when it bursts open, releasing active ingredients that reverse and treat damage of that area and neutralize free radicals. And so, that’s how we’re able to say an 82-year-old woman will get something different from it than a 19-year-old—because their skin has different needs. But everyone can use it, because the free radical activity in your skin dictates where those active ingredients are released. So it’s going to age with you.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What’s the best piece of beauty wisdom you’ve ever received from someone older and younger than you?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My grandmother always said that good skin is for everyone, and her best advice was that everyone has different skin, [so] don’t follow what other people do. Figure out what’s best for your skin, and ask a lot of questions. And the best advice from a younger person? Because TikTok is everything to me, I learned about using a lighter concealer to do the opposite of contouring—highlighting the parts of your face you want to stand out, instead of darkening them. I learn a lot of makeup tips from the younger generation.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Please give us a quick breakdown of your current beauty routine.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My routine has become more simplified over the years. I used to be that girl who had a 15-step routine with 20 products in morning and 20 products at night—I boastfully wrote about it for Beauty Snob, my blog, which I started 18 years ago. And now, it’s very simple, I follow what I call the four Cs: I cleanse with the Mantle Skin Conditioning Wash, compound with our Resurfacing Compound, then creams, which are my eye and face creams.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I use our Return Eye Concentrate and Super Hydrator—but whatever you love, use it—and lastly, a cover. At nighttime, I cover my face and everything I just put on with the Barrier Bioactive Treatment as, like, a sleep mask; and in the daytime, your cover is SPF. For me, that’s my Multimodal Defender.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I do my barrier over everything, I’d say, about five times a week, but I also use a neck cream—I love a neck and dec—so, I use SiO Beauty ChestLift patches for my [décolletage] right now. I’m trying out different neck creams—we don’t have one, but I really believe in them; I think they’re very necessary. The neck is so unique and different. That’s something I have yet to figure out, because I will not just come out with something for a cash grab. The technology has to be so insane, it has to be incredible. And then, the rest of your body! At night, I only use our Resurfacing Body Compound, because it really helps with cellular turnover while you sleep.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I only wash my hair twice a week, and I switch off. Some days I use Olaplex—about once or twice a month—and I’m obsessed with Fable & Mane’s HoliRoots prewash hair treatment oil. I love the way it smells. I have a lot in my arsenal that I rotate. I also use Nick Stenson’s luxury skincare products, who’s a friend of mine, along with Wendy Iles, who is a lovely founder that came to my room in Paris and did my hair for me. I like to air-dry as much as possible because I get my hair done for events so much, I try to leave it alone. But I did recently start using the new Dyson Airstrait—it’s next level.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For makeup, I like using my skincare as makeup—I think the best thing is when I have nothing on my face but my U Beauty and Super Tinted. I love our Super Tinted Hydrator—it just evens out your skin tone, it’s not really a heavy cover. And then I put on the Plasma Lip Compound. I’m also obsessed with Haus Labs—Lady Gaga’s eyeliners are bar none the best ever. I use the black and silver shades on my upper lids. If I need some concealing, I love using Shiseido’s Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Concealer, and I live for Jones Road Face Pencils to highlight. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/health/a42885264/take-the-edge-off-bobbi-brown/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Bobbi’s class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Bobbi’s</a> one of my mentors—I’ve known her for almost 20 years. I’m a product junkie, I just love products!</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What keeps you feeling vibrant and youthful?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think what keeps me feeling youthful is just being curious—my dad taught me this. I have four brothers, and when I was younger one day, they were climbing walls, and I was sitting there properly. My grandmother was like, “Just sit there. Don’t act like the boys.” And my dad’s like, “What are you doing?” and I said, “I’m just sitting here watching the garden. Grandmother told me to watch her flowers.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And he said, “Aren’t you curious what the boys are discovering behind that wall? You have to be curious—if you’re not curious, you’re not living.” So, I’m always curious, and that makes me feel young—makes me feel relevant, and youthful. Stay curious, whether it’s about the latest skincare, like, do your research. Don’t blindly listen to me. I’m just one person. This is my point of view. There’s so many different point of views. I always like to glean from so many people and then make my own decision.</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Many people fear growing older. In your opinion, what’s the best part about it?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you change the way you look at aging, the way you age will change. I came up with that based on Laozi, a Chinese philosopher. He always said, “If you change the way you look at life, the life you live will change. If you change the way you look at things, things will change.” So, I took it a step further into aging.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They say a woman of a certain age shouldn’t wear these half crop tops. Why? If you have abs and you look hot, why not? And even if you don’t have abs, if you feel hot, wear it! That’s why I don’t like to define a person by their age. My opinion means so much more to me than other people’s opinion of me. I used to be that person who would be like, “Oh my god, what do you think of this dress?” So, I think that’s the best part of aging—just not giving a shit.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tiffany Dodson is currently the associate beauty commerce editor at Harper’s Bazaar, where she specializes in trend forecasting, building relationships with major and emerging brands, and crafting shopping stories—from holiday gift guides to product road tests.
