He's your friend!" Brolin said, to which Colbert began calling for the Oscar-nominated filmmaker backstage, before jumping over the back wall and running off stage.</p><p>While Colbert was occupied, Brolin hopped over his chair, and took a seat behind Colbert's desk. "We'll be right back with Stephen Colbert," he joked, impersonating the late-night host. "We got a great show for you tonight!"</p><p>Colbert returned and kicked him out of his chair, before Brolin told him, "I just wanted to know what it was like to be uncool."</p><p>The crowd reacted to the Avengers: Endgame star's faux diss, and Colbert responded with a question, asking Brolin if the beverage in his mug was coffee or water.</p><p>"That's water," he replied, before Colbert then dipped his fingers in the liquid and splashed it right into Brolin's face.</p><p>He jumped out of his seat, and then ran over to Colbert's desk and pretended to urinate on it. Colbert hilariously responded by pretending to wipe it up.</p><p>"I'm sorry that wasn't nice," Colbert said, to which Brolin joked, "I like being here more than I like being at home."</p><p>Villeneuve then came out on stage, and the three discussed how to correctly pronounce his name. The French Canadian filmmaker admitted that Brolin was correct, but said Colbert was "not bad." Brolin and Colbert continued to argue, with the former accusing the latter of copying him.</p><p>"I regret inviting you out here," Colbert joked to Villeneuve, who then said goodbye to Brolin and Colbert, before returning backstage.</p><p>Surprisingly, the pals continued to have a somewhat normal, but still very entertaining, conversation, with Brolin talking about his Dune book, learning how to play a fictional instrument for the film, and more, including the Oscar nominee reading his hilarious Dune: Part 2 synopsis he<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> recently shared</strong></a> on Instagram.</p><p>Check out more from the interview in the clips, below.</p><p>Dune: Part Two hits theaters Friday.</p><a id=gallery-link-56c7dc2e-4b2e-4e1e-abe8-4c25fe00eede class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:56c7dc2e-4b2e-4e1e-abe8-4c25fe00eede data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:28aac6d7-297e-49e5-92b7-dafdbe458c0e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b3/4by3/2024/02/26/b39b96c1d2ad4ede985e89e9b3fa489f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tma3Bfn7y0tIybqaikmaN6p63KnmSpnZWoeqvBzKmqZpqVnbavsIysq56omJq7bq%2FOpZmeqqRisaa%2FymaaoZmfqbakecuaq55lo528uHnIp6ueqqaesrh7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./my-mother-bette-davis-drunken-monster-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>My mother, Bette Davis, a drunken monster</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daithi-de-nogla.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daithi DeNogla - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
