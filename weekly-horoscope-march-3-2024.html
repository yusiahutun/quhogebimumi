Whoever said turbulence couldn’t make things more interesting?</p><p>Get ready for emotional fireworks as this week begins. Kicking things off with a last quarter moon in Sagittarius on March 3, you may feel increasingly willing to act on instinct and go a little overboard. And as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">independent Venus in Aquarius</a> squares off with unpredictable Uranus in Taurus, you may find that stubbornness and rising tension leads to unexpected shifts in your relationships. This could lead to surprise crushes that throw everything off balance, but also shocking separations that may or may not last. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">empathic Mercury in Pisces</a> forms a sextile with innovative Uranus on March 4, you’ll be in a beautiful position to take up the mantle on something new without letting fear hold you back.</p><p>However, the energy will get a little weird by March 8. OK, weird is an understatement, because this is when Mercury in Pisces will join forces with Neptune, <a href=#>planet of dreams and </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dissolution</a>. Mercury is already in detriment while moving through Pisces, placing far more importance on facts than fiction. And with Neptune in the mix, you’ll be far more susceptible to spreading lies or believing in falsehoods. Instead of getting scammed, focus all your attention on expanding your imagination and engaging in creative efforts that expand your heart. Make sure you write your dreams down, because they will be filled with psychic insight.</p><p>However, unexpected friction could lead to inconveniences by March 9, when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">argumentative Mars in Aquarius</a> squares off with frenetic Uranus in Taurus. Don’t allow rash behavior to lead to disruptions that could easily have been avoided. And as Mercury enters Aries at 11:03 p.m. ET, this week ends with you feeling bold in your ideas and brash in your delivery. Instead of turning your passion into conflict, pour it into your goals and let it fan the flames of your success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-the-planets-will-affect-your-zodiac-sign-this-week>How the Planets Will Affect Your Zodiac Sign This Week</h2><p>Here’s what you can expect from the upcoming week, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>your sun</a> and/or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> (and seriously, you’re missing out if you don’t read these horoscopes for your rising sign):</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7488986784141><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_aries.png><p>The week begins on Sunday, March 3, with Venus in Aquarius and your house of friendships squaring Uranus in Taurus.
