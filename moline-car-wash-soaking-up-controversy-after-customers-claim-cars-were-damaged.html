He says that is going to cost him several hundred dollars to do.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wasn’t asking for a million dollars. I was just asking for them to help me get this fixed, resolve it, get it right,” he said.</p><p>On Thursday, Durbin shared a Facebook post about his experience with the car wash, with a video of the damage. In just a matter of hours, the post had been shared more than 75 times, and received hundreds of comments.</p><p>As of Thursday evening, Local 4 News had counted comments from 14 different people claiming their cars were also damaged at Extreme Clean.&nbsp;</p><p>“Quite a bit of a surprise really,” said Durbin.&nbsp;“There were a lot of comments with people saying the same thing has happened to them. When you get this many people then it’s not a coincidence.”&nbsp;</p><p>One of the commenters was Seth McKay, who says his red 2018 Mustang was also scratched. McKay says it happened to him about a month ago, and he didn’t realize it until he went to have his car detailed the next day. McKay says at the time, he did not file a complaint with the car wash because he didn’t think they would fix the damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I noticed everyone having issues, it’s just kind of something that needs to be addressed. I’m glad I stopped taking my car there when I did because I may have ended up in the same position [Durbin] is&nbsp;in.”</p><p>“Why would we blame him if it happened anywhere else?” said Durbin. “I have no reason to pin this on this guy.”</p><p>Local 4 News followed up with Extreme Clean and the owners declined an on-camera interview. But they did share surveillance video with us of Durbin entering and leaving the car wash. They say it’s clear from the video that Durbin’s car was not damaged when it was leaving the car wash.</p><p>They also shared surveillance video of an owner handing Durbin the car wax they purchased to repair it.&nbsp;</p><p>On Thursday,&nbsp;Durbin says he stands by his claims.&nbsp;</p><p>“The car was at&nbsp;Waterpark&nbsp;car wash maybe two weeks prior, and I walked around it then and it looked great,” he said.&nbsp;“So I know it happened that day.”</p><p>Now he says it’s not just about getting his car fixed, but about getting the word out.&nbsp;</p><p>“I figured everybody should really see this and maybe they don’t pay enough attention to their cars as I do, so they should maybe keep an eye on that thing to keep this from happening,” said Durbin.</p><p>Because while he may be able to erase the scratches, Durbin says after this experience there’s some damage that just can’t be undone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“At this point I have a very bad taste in my mouth…there’s no going back to that.”</p><p>The owners went on to tell Local 4 News they do not scratch cars. They say the surveillance video proves Durbin’s car was not damaged by their car wash. They added that they take pride in their work, and run a good, honest business.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46mpqWhnpp6pK3RZq6aq5hiwLCtyqKloGWlpXqku82tqaiulafAunnAn6ueql2YwrTAzqacq6tdmLmitcxmmpqqo2LEpr7EZpuapZGcsqV7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pat-boone-crystal-gayle-you-and-i-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pat Boone Teams With Crystal Gayle for Emotional New Video</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-davis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Davis Biography, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
