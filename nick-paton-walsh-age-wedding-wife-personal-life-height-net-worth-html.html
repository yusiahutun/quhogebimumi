In his column Me and My Motor, celebrities shared the information about their car. Not only had this but he also wrote articles on different matters that won him an award in young age. During his stay there, he also covered the revolutions in various countries and won the Amnesty International's Gaby Rado Award for his projects in the&nbsp;Sri Lanka&nbsp;and the&nbsp;former Soviet&nbsp;Union.</p><p style=text-align:justify>His career in television began in 2011 after joining the CNN from Pakistan. He was in Benghazi, Libya at the time of deposition of the dictator Gaddafi after which he became the channel’s full-time correspondent in Kabul.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Net Worth and Salary:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The man has risked his life in many situations to provide the news about the wars in different countries. He has now become a significant influence to CNN and earns a remarkable salary for all the hard work he has done. He also has an exquisite net worth derived from his long career in journalism media.

When it comes to his relationship status, there’s no talk about it at all. He has not spoken about any matters that goes on in his life. The daring journalist seems not much brave about the significant other of his life.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187></span><span data-ez-ph-id=187 style="max-width:580px;line-height:0;min-width:580px;min-height:400px;border:0 solid #ddd!important;margin-right:auto!important;display:block!important;margin-bottom:15px!important;background-color:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;float:none!important;margin-top:15px!important;padding:0;background:rgba(128,128,128,5%)!important;width:580px;margin-left:auto!important;text-align:center!important"></span><p style=text-align:justify>&nbsp;At the age of 40, it won’t be a crime for us to assume that he is in a relationship but watching his report from different parts of the world can rather confuse us. As he spends all&nbsp;of his time visiting the war-torn zones and is more on the foreign land than the homeland, it’s hard to imagine that a wife is waiting for him at home.</p><p style=text-align:justify>There is no known evidence of his wedding or him being a married person. But it doesn’t imply or on any circumstance claim that he is a gay. It’s just that he hasn’t revealed the actual status of his personal life.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Short Bio:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Nick Paton Walsh currently aged 40 was born in 1977 and has a birthday on 26th&nbsp;of November.
