The couple got married in 2016 but had been dating secretly for a few years. Eva Longoria and José Bastón <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first met in 2009,</a> when Eva visited Televisa studios to be interviewed. At the time, she was still married to her ex-husband, Tony Parker.</p><p class=align-left>The first meeting was not significant, and Eva even claims to have no recollection. In 2013, the couple would meet again on a blind date through a mutual friend. At the time, they were both going through a hard time due to failed relationships. Six months, the couple were re-introduced by the same mutual friend, and this time there was a connection.</p><p class=align-left>They started dating soon after but kept the relationship out of the public eye. However, after a few months of dating, they were spotted attending events together and holding hands, confirming their relationship. In 2015, Baston proposed, and the couple got married about a year later in Mexico.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5bafbde0dc926906.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Angel Adoree Strawbridge: 10 quick facts about the Escape to the Chateau star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>wedding</a> was a luxurious affair, limited to about 80 guests in Bastón’s home in Mexico.

Longoria wore a beautiful wedding dress, which was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">designed by her friend</a>, Victoria Beckham.</p><h3>Jose Bastón past marriage</h3><p class=align-left>Bastón’s marriage is not the first – he was previously married to Natalia Esperón, a Mexican actress and model. The couple were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married for ten years</a> and even had children together. However, in 2005, Natalia Esperón and José Antonio Bastón's marriage fell apart, ending in divorce.</p><p class=align-left>Eva Longoria’s marriage to Baston is also not her first either.
