But, with the cameras placed at every angle, every curve gets noticed.</p><p>Sarah Snook also faced questions regarding weight gain due to a slight change in her figure in the show 'Succession.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>So much so that after the&nbsp;weight gain speculation, people even jumped on to make assumptions about her being pregnant.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, we barely notice any extra pounds on her. Moreover, a little weight gain or loss does not change the fact that Sarah is an amazing actress.</p><p>While she hasn't directly commented on the weight gain comments, she has made another bold statement in the November issue of <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Vogue Australia</a>, in which she graced the cover page in a stunning red Dior dress. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Snook claimed that she would no longer be working out and losing weight to look a certain way for a role.</p><p>Instead, she boldly bashes the beauty standards set by the media on women and bravely chooses to defy them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She shared that she has felt the pressure too, "I mean, every time you get a role, you're like: 'Oh, this one's the one. I'm going to really work out and get fit and look like the movie star I would hope to become or have a career doing."</p><p></p><p><strong>Sarah Snook Looking Gorgeous On The Red Carpet (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">W Magazine</a>)</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But things have changed now for the star as she has moved forward from the binds of the beauty standards. She said,</p><p>Can I really be f*cked subscribing to an unrealistic beauty standard that then perpetuates and makes more women unhappy because they feel like they can’t attain something that’s not actually realistic anyway?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>And we couldn't agree more! While people focus on some petty weight gain, Sarah is out there unbothered and achieving one milestone after another.</p><p>However, it doesn't mean that she isn't keeping herself healthy. She does love a good workout, but her method is quite peculiar.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Yoga, pilates, the gym, or even a simple run would be your first thought when you think of a pretty actress's workout routine, but Sarah's approach might come as a surprise.</p><p><strong>Also, check out:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Inside James Phelps's Sneaky Love Life and Marriage</a></strong></p><p>She shared with Vogue that she is staying in shape by chopping wood in her backyard!&nbsp;"I've been chainsawing and chopping wood to keep in shape," says the Australian beauty. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;Sarah has the audience hooked on the show, and her performance on-screen is marvelous.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Besides 'Succession,' she has also starred in 'Not Suitable for Children,' 'Predestination,' 'The Beautiful Lie,' 'The Secret River,' 'Sisters of War,' and 'These Final Hours.'</p><p>She has bagged multiple awards through her performances, including the&nbsp;Screen Actors Guild Awards and Golden Globe Awards. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Needless to say, the remarks on her weight gain make no difference to her thriving career. Moreover, the actress also recently got married&nbsp;to&nbsp;Dave Lawson, so it's nothing but good news in life for Sarah.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqyYq5mYYsCvu86kZLCdmZy1tXnGmqCnZpipuq0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zac-brown-band-from-the-fire-tour-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zac Brown Band Ready Summer 2023 Headlining From the Fire Tour</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./orlando-bloom-pokes-fun-at-fiancee-katy-perrys-coachella-look-heres-what-the-actor-said-1299909.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Orlando Bloom Pokes Fun At Fiance Katy Perry's Coachella Look; Here's What The Actor Said</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
