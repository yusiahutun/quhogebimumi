She worries about everything, and that includes what to bring to class for 100th Day. Nothing she can think of seems right. 100 ice cubes? Too melty. 100 marshmallows? Too sticky. 100 toothpicks? Too pointy. Jessica counts, adds, and multiplies her way to the 100th day of class. And in the end, with the loving support of her family, finds the answer to her 100th Day worries.</p><p id=e4opQDmBwVps- data-wc=47>Parents say: "This is a delightful book and gives very helpful strategies for managing worries.

Bought for my son when he was 5. The day after I read it to him he was terrified but wasn't able to tell me in a public place. I took him home. He relaxed.
