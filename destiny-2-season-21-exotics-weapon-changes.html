Explore the depths of Destiny 2’s exotic weapon changes coming in Season 21.</p><p>With revamped perks and mechanics, your exotics will become even more formidable, offering an edge in battles against the forces of darkness. Join us to showcase the exciting improvements in exotic weapons that will change your gameplay.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2 Season 21 Weapon Changes: Weapon Reticles, Auto Melee, Exotic Weapon & More</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Exotics Weapon Changes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/1-2.jpg><p>We will showcase all the exotic weapon changes in Season 21 and what Bungie plans to change for future seasonal updates. Some of these exotic weapons are getting Buffed, and others are getting slightly nerfed. At the end of the day, time will tell if these changes were good or bad.</p><p>Let’s take a look at all the exotic weapon changes coming in Season 2:</p><ul><li>Eyes of Tomorrow’s multi-targeted missile volley and “Adaptive Ordnance” Exotic trait suggest it should be used to kill groups of enemies, but the Rocket Launcher ammo economy doesn’t really allow for that. But what if smart use of the weapon against groups refunded ammo?<ul><li>Killing 4 targets with a missile volley will refund one ammo.</li></ul></li><li>Graviton Lance’s performance feels Exotic, but it was easy to miss out on the full damage of a burst because so much of it was back-loaded, and we felt the tuning of Revision Zero’s Heavy Rounds 2-burst would be a good fit.<ul><li>Increased RPM from 257 to 300 (reduced burst delay by 20%, now matches Revision Zero’s Hakke Heavy Rounds rate of fire).</li><li>Rebalanced damage per shot.<ul><li>Increased first shot damage from:<ul><li>Body: 9.5 to 19.</li><li>Crit: 15.7 to 31.4.</li></ul></li><li>Decreased second shot damage from:<ul><li>Body: 35.6 to 25.6.</li><li>Crit: 58.7 to 42.3.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Jade Rabbit is a strong PvP Scout Rifle. Still, it was difficult to keep track of the state of the Exotic perk, and refunding single ammo just wasn’t impressive enough for an Exotic—these changes make the state clearer and provide more reward for precision.<ul><li>Added buff text to show when Fate of All Fools increased body shot damage is active.</li><li>Quickly hitting 3 critical hits now refunds 3 shots instead of 1.</li></ul></li><li>Flying around with The Manticore is some silly fun, but we wanted it to be more rewarding, mobile, and sustainable. With this change, you should be able to remain airborne for longer and be safer while doing so.<ul><li>Increased the catalyst’s damage resistance from tier 3 to tier 4.</li><li>Increased movement speed during hang time.</li><li>Activating the catalyst perk (through an airborne kill or sustained damage following an airborne kill) now partially refills the magazine.</li></ul></li><li>Lumina’s cap on Noble Rounds was 5; while working on Exotic weapon reticles, we opted to match Ace of Spades’ Memento Mori shot count to improve consistency between the two and give Lumina a little buff at the same time.<ul><li>Increased Noble Rounds cap from 5 to 6.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Heartshadow wasn’t quite hitting the fantasy we wanted it to, so we’ve made it easier to exploit the Exotic perks.<ul><li>Damage increase now activates quicker while invisible, after 0.25s instead of 1s.</li><li>Heartshadow now weakens upon dealing any damage while the damage increase is active.</li></ul></li><li>We love Worldline Zero’s performance, and with all of the attention we’ve been giving Swords, we wanted to spend some time really differentiating it from a certain perk on glowing Sword Dares.<ul><li>The sprinting Heavy attack can now be chained into itself once.<ul><li>Sword guard energy cost from each sprinting heavy attack was reduced from 100% to 50%.</li><li>Decreased damage from an individual sprinting heavy attack by 25% to compensate.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2-2.jpg><ul><li>Sweet Business’s performance is a lot of fun, but we felt we could go really, plus its fun factor and strength by adding some explosions.<ul><li>Now fires explosive rounds every 20 shots (fewer shots while fully spun up).</li></ul></li><li>Legend of Acrius hits extremely hard already, dealing some of the highest damage per shot in the game, but its ammo reserves run out fairly quickly, and you have to be right on top of enemies to use it; we’ve relaxed both of those constraints.<ul><li>Increased total ammo from 12 to 16.</li><li>Increased maximum projectile distance from 9m to 12m.</li></ul></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3-3.jpg><ul><li>Tommy’s Matchbook is all about burning yourself; we’ve updated it to let you burn others as well.<ul><li>Catalyst updated: While overheated, sustained fire scorches your target. Every 5 shots apply 14+7 (with the Embers of Ashes Fragment) scorch stacks.</li></ul></li><li>No Time to Explain’s drone wouldn’t work against Barrier Champion shields when it had an anti-barrier effect; we’ve fixed that and also made the drone work with the Feeding Frenzy perk.<ul><li>Updated drone to work with anti-barrier (will break Barrier Champion shields and over-penetrate combatant shields).</li><li>Updated drone to work with Feeding Frenzy (from the NTTE catalyst).</li><li>This also resolved an issue where the feedback for Feeding Frenzy would always play when the player spawned and then never again.</li></ul></li><li>Skyburner’s Oath’s Solar 3.0 pass turned out to be too conservative, so we’ve brought it up to be more competitive with other scorching options.<ul><li>Increased scorch stacks from 3 to 5 and 5 to 10 with the Embers of Ashes Fragment.</li></ul></li><li>Salvation’s Grip’s performance and utility are entertaining and situationally useful. Still, as a Heavy weapon, it really needs to do some damage without compromising on its identity—we’ve rebuilt its functionality using bowling as inspiration.<ul><li>Reworked to have two firing modes. Charged shot creates a pattern of Stasis crystals (where the number of crystals is no longer dependent on charge time). An uncharged shot is a normal Grenade Launcher shot, which does more damage to Stasis crystals and frozen targets.</li><li>Added a new perk that reloads the magazine from reserves when you quickly shatter at least 3 crystals with the uncharged shot.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Bad Juju has always been hard to control, and it turns out that this is because it was originally set up to use Auto Rifle recoil.<ul><li>Fixed an issue that was causing the weapon to recoil like an Auto Rifle, making it harder to control. The recoil pattern will now be similar to other Pulse Rifles.</li></ul></li><li>Fighting Lion’s damage against red bars spiked to massive levels due to a recent bug; we’ve addressed this—but note that it still receives the 40% damage bonus for Exotic Primary weapons.<ul><li>Fixed an issue that was causing this weapon to do more damage than intended to red-bar combatants.</li></ul></li><li>Thunderlord has surged in popularity with the release of its catalyst and the Season 20 Machinegun buff. Still, it shipped with a bug that allowed lightning strikes at a higher frequency than intended against Divinity bubbles. We’ve addressed that—note that the change does not affect regular crits.<ul><li>Fixed an issue resulting in hits against a Divinity bubble counting as two crits instead of one.</li></ul></li><li>Winterbite’s initial version included an exploitable damage bug, which is fixed here.<ul><li>The impact damage has been removed and redistributed to the detonation damage.</li><li>The self-damage scaling has been tuned to account for the increased damage of the detonation.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Read More: Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2 Season Of Defiance Gear, Ranked</a></strong></p><p>These are all the exotic weapon changes coming in Season 21.
