If you’re curious about <a href=#>how the full moon in Sagittarius of June 2023</a> will affect each zodiac sign, it is best to keep an open mind.</span></p><p><span>After all, while the moon glimmers brightly through this eternally optimistic fire sign, it will sit in direct opposition of the <a href=#>sun in fact-checking Gemini</a>. Where do these mutable signs <a href=#>reside in your birth chart</a>? Savvy Mercury and benevolent Jupiter are both key players in this lunation, but tempering the contradicting synergy of Gemini-Sagittarius is where we regain balance. Also known as the astrological axis of knowledge, Gemini’s instinct to gather information firsthand is equivalent to Sagittarius’ broad perspective, and universal POV. Polar opposites indeed, but one cannot exist without the other.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As you may remember, the sun sits across from the moon <a href=#>during the full moon phase</a>. The sun is a representation of the ego and our physical identity, while the moon represents our innermost feelings and emotional foundation. When these ever-glowing luminaries are in direct opposition to one another, there is an “imbalance” between our feminine (moon) and masculine (sun) energies. This is partly why this lunar phase is so climactic, as it is a symbol of completion. The moon’s brightness is what illuminates what’s been hidden from our conscious mind which, in turn, serves as a full-circle moment. For reference, think back to the <a href=#>new moon in Sagittarius</a> that took place in November 2022. Where were you mentally and spiritually? Were you seeking some sort of wisdom, or perhaps pondering about the future? The possibilities are endless in the eyes of the archer.</span></p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote>The full moon in Sagittarius takes place on June 3 at 11:42 p.m. ET.</figure><p><span>On June 3 as of</span><span>&nbsp;11:42 p.m. ET, the moon will peak at exactly 13 degrees of adventurous Sagittarius, so expect revelations! (Although, that would be putting it lightly when considering the astrological aspects at play..) With Sagittarius’ planetary ruler, Jupiter, officially transiting the security-seeking sign of Taurus, there is greater emphasis on our values and sense of self-worth. Moreover, the sun will be cruising through the same degrees as <a href=#>Mars retrograde in Gemini 2022</a>, adding another layer of information to consider but we’ve come a long way since this perplexing retrograde cycle, and Jupiter in Taurus is simultaneously reminding us of what we’re capable of creating, experiencing and manifesting in this lifetime. Jupiter will also harmonize with Saturn, which continues to shed light on what you’re building, as well as what you’re ready to surrender, in order to create the life you seek.</span></p><p><span>BTW, if you’re secretly hoping for a lightbulb moment, just wait! Mercury will be in close proximity to change-maker Uranus, which could bring sudden and unexpected news. And with both of these planets transiting Taurus, chances are this revelation revolves <a href=#>around our finances and/or sense of security</a>. For reference, check where Taurus lives in your birth chart, as there is a stellium of energies shaking things up as we speak. On a more exhilarating note, the full moon will form an energizing trine to Mars in Leo, and this could supercharge you with confidence, enthusiasm and creative inspiration. Are you ready to pursue your ultimate goals and dreams? This lunation says you have the energy, determination, and faith to make it happen.</span></p><p><span>If your&nbsp;<a href=#>sun sign</a>, <a href=#>moon sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following zodiac signs, the upcoming full moon will be surprisingly validating. Here’s why:</span></p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3380024360536><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Aries.webp><p>Your perception around finances and security continues to evolve, but you are transcending a lack mentality in the process. Governed by Jupiter in Taurus—via your stability-seeking second house of creature comforts and sensual delights—what was once TBD is finally coming full-circle for you. The infinite possibilities and what if’s are slowly but surely making sense, as the moon will reach its peak via your expansive ninth house of faith, wisdom and unknown territory. More importantly, with Mercury in close proximity to change-maker Uranus, unexpected news could be what catapults you forward. The best part? Your celestial ruler, Mars, is back in its fiery element, and you’re as energized and courageous as ever. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.315205327414><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Taurus.webp><p>You don’t need anyone’s approval to succeed, let alone thrive in your element. Where have you been investing your time and energy? With the ruler of this lunation (Jupiter) transiting your sign, you are in your right to embody your main-character energy, even if that means taking a step back from friendships and goals you no longer resonate with. On that note, amidst the moon reaching its peak via the most intimate sector of your birth chart, Mercury will join forces with Uranus in your sign. Is there something you’d like to get off your chest? Your words could create a shocking ripple effect, but the truth sets you free. Fortunately, with the help of your luscious planetary ruler, Venus, you have the charm to relay the message, as well as the support of those in your immediate environment. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8811563169165><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gemini.webp><p>The possibilities are endless, because nothing is ever guaranteed. And though you’re more likely to feel nostalgic and sentimental about your values with Venus transiting Cancer, this full moon is bringing awareness to everything from family traditions to the outdated belief systems you’ve unknowingly prioritized within your one-on-one relationships. This is especially true when considering the moon’s ruler, Jupiter, as it will ignite your 12th house of unconscious patterns. Either way, you could be coming to terms with something you’ve recently discovered about a significant other and/or partnership firsthand. For instance, is this newly found value system (within your relationships) something you wouldn’t normally approve of? If it’s a belief around a significant other’s finances, how has your philosophy evolved? <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3245521601686><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cancer.webp><p>Light reflects light and with Venus dazzling your cardinal waters, there’s no denying your sparkling presence.&nbsp; This is especially true when considering your sense of belonging in the professional sphere, as the ruler of this lunation (Jupiter) continues to wander through your 11th house of aspiration, social contributions and friendship groups. More importantly, with Venus transiting your sign and the full moon lighting up your sixth house off day-to-day affairs, the cosmos is encouraging you to reflect on your sense of self-worth, as well as the value of your unique talents, skills and abilities. On that note, whatever’s coming full-circle for you could simultaneously inspire you to take an exhilarating risk, one of which could test your self-confidence but… with Mars sizzling through Leo, you know exactly what you bring to the table. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.8518024032043><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Leo.webp><p>Surrendering the attachments that leave you energetically depleted will set you free. Although, with the full moon touching down on your expressive fifth house of love, passion and authenticity, there is an opportunity to take the lead. This could be something you’ve been working on behind the scenes, or an investment you’ve been secretly contemplating. Either way, the grounding influence of Jupiter in Taurus is helping you prioritize your goals, both personally and professionally speaking. And though you’ve never been short of courage, Mars’ sizzling journey through your sign provides the audacity and energy needed to embark on this journey. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3837939698492><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Virgo.webp><p>The ambiguous fog that hovered over your sense of security is slowly dissipating. Governed by wisdom-seeking Jupiter—via your ninth house of expansion, opportunity and self-discovery—everything from your philosophy around home and family to your definition of “home sweet home” is beginning to shift. Your celestial ruler, Mercury, will also join forces with rebellious Uranus, adding a layer of unexpected news and/or change of plans moving forward. Meanwhile, Venus’ journey through Cancer—your 11th house of community affairs—sheds a light on the support (or lack thereof) of your friends and family, but you’re being encouraged to lean into your intuition and follow your true north. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.7895335608646><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Libra.webp><p>Are you confident in your personal life, or do you feel inhibited by a personal commitment? Whether financially or in terms of home and family, this lunation is bringing awareness to the foundation of your mindset, and immediate exchanges. This could be for better or for worse, as you are simultaneously confronting power dynamics and taboo topics within your inner circle. Your celestial ruler, Venus, will continue transiting your bossy 10th house of reputation and public persona, so if it doesn’t revolve around a prominent parent, this could have something to do with your professional life. On another note, some of you could’ve been entertaining the thought of asking for a raise at work.

Activating your second house of comfort, finances and security, you could experience a full-circle moment when in regards to your beliefs around “giving and receiving,” whether financially or in terms of loyalty. Although, with Venus swimming through your expansive ninth house of self-discovery, you could also gain insight on a lucrative opportunity, if not a new-found sense of fulfillment. In other news, if you’re expecting news around a professional opportunity, Mars in Leo thrives in competitive environments, and Mercury’s close proximity to Uranus is shaking things up. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3318181818182><h2>Sagittarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sagittarius.webp><p>The moon is sparkling just for you, and with the help of your planetary ruler (Jupiter in Taurus), you’re slowly-but-surely creating the life you crave.

Mercury will be in close proximity to freedom-loving Uranus, adding a layer of shock and unconventionality, so try to steer away from expectations and/or one-sided situations.

Although, if it’s not praise or acknowledgement, you could be revisiting a passion project that has the potential to be monetized, if not committing to a solid plan of action when in regards to your personal branding. The moon is peaking in Sagittarius, bringing emphasis to your 12th house of unconscious patterns and life behind the scenes. This could, in turn, highlight the parts of yourself you’ve unknowingly discredited, or simply disregarded for the sake of keeping a low profile. Then again, with Venus dazzling your relationship sector, one thing’s for sure: you have the support and validation of your loved ones. Jupiter will harmonize with your taskmaster ruler, Saturn, and this is simultaneously encouraging you to trust the process, and the power of divine timing. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3414932680539><h2>Aquarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Aquarius.webp><p>Do you feel safe within your social networks?

You simply can’t deny what your soul deeply craves, despite the circumstances that surround your current reality. Similarly, you could gain a new-found perspective on home and family, while others of you explore other places of residence.

If you’re in the process of applying for a professional opportunity or simply prioritizing your public persona, you’re in luck as the full moon will ignite your 10th house of authority, career and reputation in the world. Fortunately, with its ruler (Jupiter) illuminating your third house of immediate surroundings, you have the resources and money mind needed to seal the deal moving forward. This is especially true for those of you exploring ways to market your talents, skills and abilities. The most auspicious part of all is that Jupiter will harmonize with taskmaster Saturn in your sign.
