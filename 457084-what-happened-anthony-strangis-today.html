He is famous for being a con man, criminal, gambler, and the ex-husband of Sarma Melngailis. Unfortunately, there is not much about Anthony Strangis's background.</p><p class=align-left>Strangis is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">native of Massachusetts</a>, and he grew up in Sarasota, according to different publications. Here, he was around people involved in criminal activities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1ae7cc1fb8de0694.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Tia Torres's husband, Aren Marcus Jackson?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Ever since Anthony Strangis came into the limelight because of his crimes, hardly any of his <a href=#>family</a> members have come out to give an interview and provide more insight about his life. However, a source discovered that his father (John J Strangis Sr.) worked for the Brockton Police Department for more than 25 years. Strangis’ father retired from the force in 1989.</p><h2>Anthony Strangis’s career</h2><p class=align-left>Anthony's history shows that he is a conman by profession, considering the numerous convictions he has over the years. Before meeting with Melngailis, Anthony was charged with various fraudulent activities, including impersonating a police officer and stealing a sports car in Florida (which led to a grand theft charge).</p><p class=align-left>It seems like Strangis had a gambling addiction. Strangis’s mother, Patricia Strangis, opened up about Anthony's past during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Vanity Fair</a> stating that he was already interested in gambling at just three years old.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f97eca0dacf383ef.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Donal Finn? Here's everything you need to know about the actor</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Strangis utilized numerous aliases to con <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unsuspecting individuals</a> out of their hard-earned money. For example, his first ex-wife, Stacey Avery, stated that Anthony would pawn her jewellery and gadgets when she was pregnant.</p><p class=align-left>Another interesting thing is that she claimed that Strangis informed her that there were demons after him. She should channel a certain amount of money to a particular source regularly.</p><h2>How did Anthony meet Melngailis?</h2><p class=align-left>Anthony started talking to Sarma in 2011 through Twitter, and they met in November of the same year. Sarma, already well-known for her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">outstanding cooking skills </a>and business, worked in different restaurants and published several cookbooks.</p><p class=align-left>She founded Pure Food and Wine in 2004 with her partner, chef Matthew Kenney. The business was successful initially as it attracted <a href=#>various celebrities</a> such as Anne Hathaway and Rooney Mara. It had an annual income of around $7 million. However, Sarma's partner, Kenney, left the business after selling his shares to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alex Kompo: Former Siesta Key star's life and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>At the start of Sarma’s relationship with Anthony, he promised to help her business become self-sufficient and free of messy investors, but he never invested any money. Finally, after knowing each other for a while, they married in 2012.</p><p class=align-left>Strangis then started his game by telling his wife that an unknown organization was pursuing them. Next, he asked Sarma for his credentials, including phone number, email, and <a href=#>bank account</a> details and wouldn’t take no for an answer.</p><p class=align-left>According to Anthony Strangis, the money was to go towards a series of cosmic endurance tests with tremendous rewards. Sarma gave him around $1.2 million.</p><h2>What were Anthony Strangis and Sarma accused of?</h2><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Sarma’s business went down in July 2015, and the couple fled. They were arrested on May 10, 2016, after hiding in a Tennessee hotel for 40m days. They were captured after Strangis ordered a Domino’s pizza using his identity.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b099b84f833e4f1f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mizkif: real name, girlfriend, net worth, ethnicity, nationality</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The two were charged with stealing $844,000 from investors, failing to remit $400,000 in taxes and short-changing employees $40,000 in paychecks, and buying luxury items.</p><h2>What happened to Anthony Strangis?</h2><p class=align-left>Anthony and Sarma’s case went to court. Sarma pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four months on Rikers Island, while Anthony was sentenced to a year in prison and five years’ probation. His sentence ends in 2022.</p><p class=align-left>Anthony's bond was set at $350,000, and since he couldn't pay the amount, he had to stay in jail for a year before the start of his trial. And by the time he was being sentenced, he had already served most of his time in prison.</p><h2>What did Anthony do with the money?</h2><p class=align-left>According to court documents, Sarm transferred more than $1.6 million from her business account to her bank account between January 2014 and January 2015. And all the money was open for Anthony to spend, which he gambled away.

He also reportedly withdrew hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.<h2>Where is Strangis now?</h2><p class=align-left>Although there is not much known about his current whereabouts, it is known that he is already out of prison and serving the remainder of his probation sentence as a private citizen. According to his lawyer, Karliner, Strangis has a new job, uses his name, and he has moved forward.</p><h2>Is Anthony and Sarma still together?</h2><p class=align-left>Anthony Strangis and Sarma divorced in 2018 and are no longer in contact. The ending of the documentary <i>Bad Vegan </i>makes it appear that she is still in touch with Strangis.
