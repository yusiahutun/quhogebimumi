At some point between toddler years and elementary school, my perfect ring curls turned into waves, which — by the end of the day — turned into a poofed-out mess. It was when I walked into my first grade classroom with tightly braided hair on a rainy day that my teacher introduced me to the term, explaining that the hair style was also her go-to way to tame humidity-intensified unruliness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’ve since found other, more convenient solutions, like not over-brushing my hair and applying lightweight oils, but even those methods haven’t quite been able to help me achieve the silky, zero-flyaway hair of my dreams. But recently, I was introduced to a styling cream that claimed to transform hair in just a minute, and, to my dismay, it did just that.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $24; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Color Wow was founded by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chris Appleton</a>, the celebrity hair stylist whose clientele consists of A-listers from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kim Kardashian to Jennifer Lopez</a> and whose products have been used on dozens of stars including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Rihanna</a>. So it’s unsurprising one of his brand’s best-selling products is a styling cream designed to help you achieve the shiny, silky locks he creates for his clients in the comfort of your home. The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One Minute Transformation Styling Cream</a> is formulated to instantly smooth frizz and reduce bumps caused by updos and bed head. By applying just a small amount to unruly areas, the product is meant to give you smooth, salon-quality hair with minimal effort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A one-minute transformation is quite the promise, so while I was expecting to be underwhelmed I was also hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I was on day two of a blowout, and the frizz that my stylist had managed to tone down 24 hours prior was back. In an effort to get rid of it, I squeezed a dime sized amount of the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">styling cream</a> into my hand and combed it through my dry hair. My goal was to at minimum reduce the flyaways and at best revive the slept-in blow out. Gently working the product through my hair, I watched the frizz reduce before my eyes, with unruly strands seamlessly falling back into place. While the near-immediate results spoke for themselves, I was further impressed by the lightweight nature of the cream which left my hair soft to the touch. There was no stickiness or crunch, rather, my hair was glossy and bouncy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’m not alone in making this a staple of my hair routine, with more than 7,600 Amazon shoppers giving it a perfect five-star rating. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One person</a> even deemed it the “best thing that’s ever happened to [their] hair,” explaining that it’s the only thing that’s worked for reducing their curl’s humidity-induced frizz. And many shoppers rave about the simplicity of the product. “It actually took [a] very little amount to straighten my frizz with my hands only. [One] swipe through my hair and wow,” said <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one person</a>, who swears by the cream to manage their “thick, coarse,” and “kinky” locks. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another customer</a> who uses it daily wrote how impressed they were with its ability to “cut frizz instantly” while leaving “zero build-up.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">transformative styling cream</a> is my holy grail hair product, so you know I’ll be restocking for the summer. Grab a bottle of your own at Amazon for just $24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wpympaeiYsSww4yopZ5lnZ67tsDEZqurmZ6os7C%2BzJqroqeeYrWitdFmmqudkaJ6s7HVopywZWdphnd%2Bl3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tom-austen-biography-birthday-height-weight-ethnicity-girlfriend-wife-affair-marital-status-net-worth-fact-full-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tom Austen Bio, Net Worth, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Affair, Married, Ethnicity, Nationality, Fac</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tana-mongeau-chris-miles-breakup-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tana Mongeau and Chris Miles Share Bed after Cheating Accusations</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
