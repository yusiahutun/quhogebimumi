He added that he also doesn't experience many "sexual desires and urges."</p><p>When asked by Osunsami how he would label himself, Archuleta said, "I'd say that I don't know, I guess" -- before adding, "Some form of being bisexual, I'm still attracted to both ... whether I want to or not."</p><p>He also revealed that he hasn't dated another man yet. "I haven't, no," he said, adding, "In my post I mentioned I still believe in saving myself for marriage."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The singer, who grew up in the Mormon church, said that he did try to pray his same-sex attraction away, but has worked on learning to love himself and has come to an understanding that "that's how God has created me."</p><p>"I've prayed. I was praying like, God, you can do all things, you are a god of miracles and I know you've allowed the blind to see and you rose, the dead to rise again, so I'd say please take these feelings away from me because I don't wanna feel things that I shouldn't," he said. "I don't want to feel things that would be wrong. So that's been the process, I've had to learn how to love myself even when I don't understand why I'm the way I am, to learn that that's how God has created me."</p><p>"There's so many millions of other people who have gone through the same thing as me, where they've tried to change who they are," he added.</p><p>Osunsami also noted that Archuleta has "shared his truth with a few leaders in the Mormon church and has not felt rejected," adding that he will celebrate Pride this year "his way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j29ma2tfma63tcNmmKubmKq5psDAZqqesKWWuarA2Gaepplf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./more-mobile-food-pantries-are-popping-up-across-the-qca-throughout-february.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>More mobile food pantries are popping up across the QCA throughout February</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cockney-rebel-singer-steve-harley-who-had-hit-make-me-smile-dies-73.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cockney Rebel singer Steve Harley, who had a hit with Make Me Smile, dies at 73</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
