It’s believed to be an older video that she has now just shared with her <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers. The <a href=#>music</a> star is seen touching tongues with a star in a playful recording. But Billie took it down in record time.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-eilish-removes-clip-of-kissing-another-woman>Billie Eilish removes clip of kissing another woman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1175402590-1024x727.jpg><p>In a <a href=# rel=nofollow>video</a> that MailOnline suggests was taken at the LACMA Art+Film Gala&nbsp;earlier this month, the star can be seen sitting with her arms around Odessa A’zion. Odessa starred in the 2023 <a href=#>movie</a> Sitting in Bars with Cake.</p><p>The actress donned a sheer black Gucci number, and Billie’s toothcaps could be seen as their tongues touched in front of the camera. However, she quickly took the post down.</p><p>The 21-year-old was seen partying the night away with other stars, too, including&nbsp;<a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> and&nbsp;Salma Hayek. The gala and after party were hosted by Gucci and held at&nbsp;Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Billie Eilish’s daring back tattoo is remarkable – see how it travels down her back</a></p><p>It comes after the songstress recently admitted <a href=#>she was attracted to women</a> “for real” but sad that she finds them “intimidating.”</p><p>“I’ve never really felt like I could relate to girls very well. I love them so much. I love them as people,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said.</p><p>“I’m attracted to them as people. I’m attracted to them for real…,” she said. “I have deep connections with women in my life… I’m physically attracted to them. But I’m also so intimidated by them and their beauty and their presence.”</p><p>Despite the confession, Billie hasn’t officially come out as bisexual, gay or queer. The singer has previously declared she was “straight as a ruler” to fans.</p><p>In a resurfaced video, Billie says: “I like men, but f***ing girls are sick too so like, I have nothing against girls I just don’t find them …” she trailed off. It seemed she stopped to catch herself and said she is “going to stop talking about that.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bad-guy-is-a-stupid-song>Bad Guy is a ‘stupid’ song</h2><p>The star, who writes songs with her talented brother Finneas O’Connell, are a power duo. Their lyrics have helped push Billie into the mainstream, where the teen found fame at a young age. However, even if fans love one of her particular songs, Billie is undecided.</p><p>Earlier this year, Billie explained <a href=#>how she really felt about</a> her hit 2019 single that catapulted her to the high levels of fame she now has.</p><p>“Well, objectively, Bad Guy is like the stupidest song in the world,” Billie admitted during a <a href=#>TV </a>interview with Jimmy Kimmel. However, she doesn’t seem to hate it completely.</p><p>She continued: “But it’s really good… it’s just like you have to understand. You have to have, like, humor in it. Like, that song is I’m trolling. That song is supposed to be goofy, but it’s just funny because it’s dumb.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Billie Eilish ‘not been doing so great’ coping with fame and has ‘impending doom feelings’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aEcK7IpaOinV2atq210qFkqq2ZmLitxYydnKWdpJrAbrzHqKuoZZuewLS1zaBkmpukp7K0v4yana2domK%2Fpq%2FEp6tmm5%2Bjs6a%2F0qKmp2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-look-alikes-photoshoot.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian Look-Alikes Photoshoot | Kim Kardashian Doppelgangers Pics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-birthday.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>&amp;quot;I Love You to the Moon and Back!&amp;quot; -- See Justin Timberlake's Adorable B-Day Message to Wife Jessica</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
