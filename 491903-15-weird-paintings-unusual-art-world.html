These paintings could result from the artist’s imagination, symbolism, or simply terrible painting, among other reasons. Weird paintings have existed since time immemorial. The beauty of paintings, even those considered eerie, is that art consumers still find a way of applauding the artist or criticizing their work as they initiate discourse. Artists in the middle ages and various periods in history often made bizarre paintings as they drew inspiration from idealist expressions of their faith and beliefs, classical mythology, literature, and realism, among other elements.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b77675a103846192.jpg><p class=align-left>Famous artists have, over the years, made disturbing art. From paintings that show a disproportion of female anatomies to weird-looking animals, artists have a way of playing with their paint brushes to come up with works that are eccentric and profound simultaneously.</p><h2>15 most weird paintings</h2><p class=align-left>Weird art is sometimes called surrealism, as the word ‘surreal’ is synonymous with ‘weird’. So, what is the weirdest painting ever? Art is subjective, and art pieces are interpreted differently. No single art painting can be described as the weirdest painting ever, as hundreds of artists like Franz Sedlacek, Giuseppe Arcimboldo and Jean Fouquet have all made dozens of bizarre pieces of art.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3c4abf4892c92cb5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>German circus replaces live animals with holograms</span></p></a><h3>1. The Lovers (1928) by Rene Magritte</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/089581246b4ea6c6.jpg><p class=align-left>This oil on canvas painting depicts a man and a woman whose heads are covered in a cloth while kissing. The artist, in their creativity, wanted to portray the idea that love is blind. Two figures without faces, and only think about themselves.</p><p class=align-left>They do not see anyone else, cannot see their true selves, and to some extent, are a mystery to others. The Lovers is a fascinating painting that is also a puzzle that may not be fully unravelled. This is among the most relatable weird painting ideas.</p><h3>2. The Ugly Duchess (1513) by Quinten Massys</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/00354babcaecaf74.jpg><p class=align-left>Even before looking at the face of The Ugly Duchess, one thing catches your eye; the heart-shaped headgear. If you stare at the headgear for a while, you get the impression of looking at wicked horns.</p><p class=align-left>There are tons of things that make this image fascinating. Peek the Rosebud on the right hand of the Duchess, the low cut bodice that reveals the chest, bone deformities and curved nostrils, among other features. <a href=# title>One of the messages </a>relayed here is how the elderly and unattractive are viewed when they try to connect with opulence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79f65861462fb622.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ugliest animal in the world: 20 species and where to find them</span></p></a><h3>3. The Three Ages of a Woman (1905) by Gustav Klimt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79f65861462fb622.jpg><p class=align-left>This twentieth-century painting will make one experience feelings of joy and misery at the same time. The painting has three figures that tell the story of a woman’s life; negligence, peace, and despair. The young lady's image is interlinked with the ornament of life. Meanwhile, the old lady stands out from it.</p><p class=align-left>The contrast between the young lady's image and the naturalistic image of the old lady is symbolic. The first cycle of life comes with its endless possibilities and metamorphoses the final one; steadiness and conflict.</p><h3>4. Dante and Virgil in Hell (1850) by William Bouguereau</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/39132f42dca001ef.jpg><p class=align-left>The oil on canvas painting is captivating because of the various elements in the image. William Adolphe-Bouguereu sought inspiration from Dante’s Inferno and made a uniquely absorbing piece. One can see the demon with bat-like features, the two men who seem to be in a physical squabble, and other people overlooking the backdrop.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a8e86431881143c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Are skinwalkers real?

Dante is observing as he moves away from Virgil, while the latter, who at first glance appears to be watching the fighting men, is actually staring to the side.</p><h3>5. The Vegetable Gardener (1590) by Giuseppe Arcimboldo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b0a3db0e0b16ff57.jpg><p class=align-left>One of the most renowned weird renaissance paintings is this piece. The medium of the vegetable Gardener is oil on canvas. Giuseppe Arcimboldo has among the most unusual paintings from the Renaissance era of painters, so it is no surprise that his piece makes it to this list.</p><p class=align-left>The Vegetable Gardener is composite, which means that the painter placed the art to form the illusion of a human feature. The author used several vegetables to convey the message of various things like seasons and materials. Interestingly, when you flip the picture over, you get a still image of life with a bowl of vegetables.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9a2e599e5a1430b1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 plain lines hairstyles without braids for natural hair</span></p></a><h3>6. Hands Against Him (1972) by Bill Stoneham</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a8e86431881143c9.jpeg><p class=align-left>This image is perceived to be creepy by some but stimulating nonetheless. The painting has a doll, a boy, and palms pinned to the glass. There are dozens of interpretations and legends about this image.</p><p class=align-left>Bill Stoneham said that the painting shows him at five years of age, the door is symbolic of the dividing line between the real <a href=#>world</a> and the world of dreams, and the doll is a guide that can take the boy through this world. The hands represent alternative lives and chances.</p><h3>7. Saturn Devouring His Son (1823) by Francisco Goya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79f227bb3d353d24.jpg><p class=align-left>At first look, this image is gruesome. In the art world, legend has it that the titan Saturn was foretold that one of his offspring would take over and be in control. Saturn enjoyed being in authority. He wanted perpetual control, and this idea of being toppled displeased him vehemently.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a26d23f5ba3151c0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best guitarists in Kenya that you should know about today</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He, therefore, ate one of his children, not knowing that his wife Rei had hidden their youngest offspring, Zeus. The end had Zeus emerge victorious against the giants. With this painting, Francisco Goya was likely addressing the effects of power. This particular Francisco Goya work is among the most interesting weird paintings from history.</p><h3>8. Le Chat blanc (1894) by Pierre Bonnard</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9a2e599e5a1430b1.png><p class=align-left>Bonnard was among the renowned Post-Impressionist Symbolists at the time that referred to themselves as The Nabis (Hebrew for prophet). The Nabis believed in equating applied art with fine arts such as painting and sculpture. The <a href=#>group of artists</a> also made tapestries, decorative vases, and wall panels, together with normal canvas paintings.</p><p class=align-left>In this image, also called 'The White Cat', the animal has an oddly arched back. The curved lines of the painting bear look like Japanese prints in a real Nabis fashion. In addition, the cat’s body is disproportionate; it has long legs and misses a neck. This appearance made it look like a distant feline relative of Salvador Dali’s tall elephants.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/40566e05748959b8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Azrael in the Bible and what is his role on earth?</span></p></a><h3>9. Gabrielle d’Estrees and One of her Sisters (1594) by Francois Clouet</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/92f627ce69a62fc1.png><p class=align-left>The oil painting on the oak panel depicts The Duchess de Villars' naughtily pinching the teat of her sister while they bathed together. The sister, Gabrielle, was King Henry IV's lover. Bathing with a sibling is common all around until a particular age.</p><p class=align-left>Different cultures have various beliefs on what age one cannot bathe with their sibling. Now, this painting refutes this belief. Others translate the image as having a fetish side of homoerotic art. Another interpretation of the image is that bosom squeezing implies fertility.</p><h3>10. Medusa (C. 1598) by Caravaggio</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fdb9eca850b25ae6.png><p class=align-left>One of the Weird paintings by famous artists everyone should look up is Medusa. In this Caravaggio painting, we see the decapitated head of the Gorgon. Every history and art lover recognizes Medusa as the beautiful woman with living snakes for hair or her power to turn humans to stone at first glance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/62b6a01e01ca7373.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ funny artistic quotes and sayings that will make you laugh</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This was until Perseus decapitated her with an Athena-loaned shield. This painting is different as Caravaggio used a young man as the subject on an actual shield. Legend has it that the mirrored shield offered to Perseus enabled him to look at Medusa's reflection and let her see herself for the last time.</p><h3>11. Magdalena Ventura with Her Husband and Son (1631) by Jusepe de Ribera</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a26d23f5ba3151c0.jpeg><p class=align-left>At a quick glance, one can see a painting of two men. A deeper look will, however, tell you that the lady in the front is Abruzzi's, bearded woman. Her bosom does not look conventionally appealing, yet she is still breastfeeding her son to show that she is physically a woman.</p><p class=align-left>One may despise her male-like features, goatee and masculine frame. Magdalena's husband is looking on at a distance, in the shadows. A deeper interpretation of this painting demonstrates that Magdalena overshadows her husband, which is the opposite of the traditional marital equilibrium.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7107500456ca37cf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 15 best cartoon trios who worked perfectly together</span></p></a><h3>12. Guernica (1937) by Pablo Picasso</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/987cd5dec6f53d85.jpg><p class=align-left>A lot is happening in Guernica; <a href=#>scenes of death</a>, brutality, vulnerability, torment, and distress. There is no specified reason for this, but it appears to be pretty evident. It is stated that in 1940, Pablo Picasso called the Gestapo in Paris. It was about the painting that immediately came up. “Did you do it”? ‘No, you did it’.</p><p class=align-left>A massive canvas and fresco ‘Guernica’, Picasso penned in 1937, tells of a raid by a volunteer Luftwaffe unit on the city of Guernica, which led to the destruction of the six thousandth city. This painting was done in about four weeks and showed how destruction is caused by fascism, unkindness and grief.</p><h3>13. The Screaming Monkey Cat (1660-1679) by Abraham Mignon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/40566e05748959b8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Lovers Abraham Mignon and Still-lifes enjoy this painting because of the intricate composition of flowers, fruits, and oysters. The artwork is weird but also engrossing. Abraham Mignon was a seventeenth-century artist skilled in everything else but painting cats.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7f15a7c5c6116560.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 goofy-looking cartoon characters of all time, ranked</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Something looks off in this image, but as they say, art is subjective. This painting, also called The Overturned Bouquet, depicts the artist’s skill in the realistic rendering of flowers and insects flawlessly.</p><h3>14. The Sphinx (1907) By Georg Von Rosen</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1752f2c6f26778b6.png><p class=align-left>The Sphinx, one of the weird paintings, sold for millions. The Sphinx demonstrates the image of a horrifying cat lady with her head mounted on the lioness's body. The lion's body is far from proportional; meanwhile, one can spot the human chest between the lady's chin and armpit.</p><p class=align-left>The chest is irrelevant for a feline, which makes the painting a little bizarre. Looking at the lady’s face, one can see how odd it appears. Her face would look at the sky if she attempted to straighten her neck. Such hybrid paintings like The Sphinx are a way for artists to express an allegory of female nature as wild, unmanageable, and catastrophic.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0d76e1f6d83ae04e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 best fat cartoon characters that you'll love watching</span></p></a><h3>15. Vertumnus (1590-1591) by Giuseppe Arcimboldo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0330f1abd9912a7b.jpg><p class=align-left>The oil painting has a mix of different fruits, vegetables and flowers that form the image of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. Despite the humour conveyed by the portrait, political undertones are behind it. The choice of vegetables, fruits and flowers was the artist’s intention to reference the Roman god Vertumnus. When creating this painting, Arcimboldo also saw the perfect balance and harmony with nature embodied by the Emperor's reign.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/15ecf2d665fb9b21.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 most expensive dolls ever sold (with photos and prices)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Each of the illustrious weird paintings is loved by art enthusiasts and safely kept or displayed in various museums and art galleries worldwide. Some are sold to collectors, though only a few can afford the paintings, given how much value they carry. The painters are held in high esteem, even centuries after passing. Art never dies, and every era in history produces artists whose works immortalize their being.
