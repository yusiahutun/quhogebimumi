During my time spent working closely with her as a member of the cabinet, she has demonstrated thoughtful leadership. She is full of knowledge of both campuses, and I am comforted to know this will be a smooth transition for the University.”</p><p>According to a release:</p><p>The WIU Board of Trustees appointed Huang as WIU’s 12th president Dec. 18, 2020. During his tenure in office, Huang presided over an internationalization of the campus that saw a record number of international students enrolling at WIU and presided over the successful transfer of WIU’s 17 Division I Athletics programs to the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC). Among his accomplishments, Huang created the Office of JIDE (Justice, Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity) and established the Anti-Racism Taskforce, a body made up of faculty, staff, students and community members, launched by Huang to make recommendations and take meaningful actions to dismantle racism. In addition, Huang oversaw salary increases for both the faculty and staff.</p>Western Illinois University <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/Guiyou-Huang.jpg><p>“I am incredibly grateful for the honor of serving as the 12th president of WIU,” Huang said. “While we have faced many challenges, we have also overcome many. I appreciate the opportunity I was given to lead this great institution, and I know that the future is full of possibilities for WIU. It is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life and be closer to my family, but I will always be a Leatherneck at heart.”</p><p>“Dr. Huang brought professionalism and integrity to WIU, a leader who was an advocate for all students from all walks of life,” Chair of the WIU Board of Trustees Carin Stutz said. “During his time at WIU, he championed the Performing Arts Center, drove enrollment and re-engaged many of our alumni. The trustees thank him for his dedicated and tireless service to our university.”</p><p>As interim president, Mindrup said she is looking to the future. “I am grateful to President Huang for his steady and thoughtful leadership and his many accomplishments,” Mindrup said. “I look forward to working with the University community and our partners to align Western Illinois University’s present and future with a shared vision that positions this great institution to become increasingly responsive to opportunities to serve our students, our region and beyond in an ever-changing world.”</p><p>The Board will vote on Huang’s Separation Agreement at its regularly scheduled meeting March 22. Information regarding a presidential search will be determined by the Board at a later date.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKKroaOptm65yKebq62gYruiucSdZJqrXayytMDEq6VmoZyhtq%2B7yKxkrqaZq7Kzv8itsGahnqmys7XMZqernaOesaa602g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-mccartney-kids-4563583.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul McCartneys Kids Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-reporter-leland-vittert-dating-someone-does-he-have-a-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is reporter Leland Vittert Dating Someone?
