As to why they haven’t filed for divorce, Pinkett Smith told Hoda Kotb in a preview of an hour-long primetime interview that the two are “just not being ready yet … Still trying to figure out between the two of us how to be in partnership … In regards to, how do we present that to people? We hadn’t figured that out.”</p><p>Kotb asked about what <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1360894/august-alsina-chris-rock-selective-outrage/ rel="noreferrer noopener">exactly</a> made the marriage fracture, “Why it fractured…that — that’s a lot of things,” Pinkett Smith revealed. “By the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying. I think we were both kind of just still stuck in our fantasy of what we thought the other person should be.”</p><p>She also talked about the promise she made to <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1258938/will-smith-apology-chris-rock/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Smith</a>. “I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce.

We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.”</p><p>As for what her three kids Jaden, 25, Willow, 22, and Trey, 30 (whom Smith had with ex-wife Sheree Zampino) think of Pinkett Smith amid all of this, she said, “My children, they’re little gurus. They’ve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance.” She continued, “They love every part of me. The level of love, unconditional love that they have for me and their dad. And it’s one thing to want to be the person that gives that unconditional love. And then there’s, to be the recipient of that.”</p><p>Here’s a full timeline of Jada Pinkett Smith and August Alsina’s entanglement amid the Will Smith separation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=when-were-jada-pinkett-smith-and-august-alsina-together>When were Jada Pinkett Smith and August Alsina together?</h2><p>Here’s the timeline.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.170482420278><h2>March 2023: Chris Rock Jokes About Jada Pinkett Smith & August Alsina's relationship</h2><p>In Chris Rock’s&nbsp;Netflix special, the comedian talked about Pinkett Smith’s “entanglement” with the “No Love” singer.
