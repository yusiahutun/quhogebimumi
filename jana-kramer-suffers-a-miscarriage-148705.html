I debated posting this for the exact reason why it’s a silent struggle. I don’t want I’m sorry or sympathy. I just don’t want to feel alone. And I know I’m not. This unfortunately isn’t my first loss. When I first found out I was pregnant I wanted to shout it from the rooftop but I know for reasons like this we have to wait. So because we don’t tell many, we have to suffer silently…and suffering silently was my thing in the past, but it’s not now. For the women out there who have miscarried in the past and need support and a place to grieve their little one lost or to those in the thick of it like me who are currently grieving and in pain, let us all be there for each other. You don’t need to feel alone and maybe that’s me talking to myself but if you need a place to share, I’m here for you…and all of us are (and guys too. We sometimes silence your voice because you feel bad to express how it’s made u feel so let this be a safe place for you too). And because I don’t have all the words to say because I’m knee deep in crying and trying to listen to God, my girlfriend @alittlebitfancy says them for me. But in her Words and her story on her loss. It’s powerful and strong and those who have suffered a loss I truly feel u can heal reading her blog. I know for me it helped. Head over to her page. Her link is in the bio and also in my bio. I love you guys. #yourenotalone</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Jana Kramer</a> (@kramergirl) on Dec 9, 2017 at 10:35am PST</p><p>Jana, who welcomed <a href=#>daughter, Jolie Rae Caussin,</a> in January 2016, continued, “This unfortunately isn’t my first loss. When I first found out I was pregnant I wanted to shout it from the rooftop but I know for reasons like this we have to wait. So because we don’t tell many, we have to suffer silently…and suffering silently was my thing in the past, but it’s not now.

The couple separated just six months after Jolie’s birth amid reports that the former NFL star had cheated on Jana with multiple women. He allegedly spent time in rehab for sex addiction.</p><p>The One Tree Hill alum opened up about their complicated relationship in September. “He’s still my husband, yes… I’m just focusing on our family and trying to figure it out. Because what I say is it’s day-by-day,” she admitted. “So we’re not divorced, he’s not my estranged husband, he’s very much in my life. He is my husband, like legally he is my husband. I have a ring on my finger. We’re actively working on it.” Our thoughts are with Jana during this difficult time.</p><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=#>Life & Style.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More from Life & Style</h2><p><a href=#>‘This Is Us’ Star Chrissy Metz Opens up About 100-Pound Weight Loss!</a></p><p><a href=#>Rebel Wilson Flaunts Her Weight Loss While Showing off Her New Clothing Line!</a></p><p><a href=#>Watch Mama June’s Entire Body Transform Over Time</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2Bfrq%2BtjKSpmqWVp3q0wcWfnKurXZZ6rrXSnJirqpmWtKZ5kG1vcGhl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Bieber shares a peek inside his 6.9m home with Hailey Baldwin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./524912-how-earl-moffett-worth-pitbulls-parolees.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How much is Earl Moffett worth in Pitbulls and Parolees?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
