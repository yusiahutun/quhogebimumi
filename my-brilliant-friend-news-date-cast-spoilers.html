My Brilliant Friend is the first in a quartet of novels chronicling the volatile yet resilient lifelong friendship between two women who grew up together in a poor neighborhood in Naples: the shy and idealistic Elena (played here by Elisa Del Genio as a child and Margherita Mazzucco as a teenager) and the sharp, mercurial Lila (played by Ludovica Nasti as a child and Gaia Girace as a teenager).</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When news broke that a TV series was on the way, with HBO partnering with Italian production company Wildside and Fandango Productions, fans wondered how an adaptation could equal the intimacy and scope of Ferrante’s writing, which paints Elena and Lila’s struggle for independence against the backdrop of a rapidly changing Italy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Reporters were given their first glimpse at the series during a Television Critics Association press tour panel this week, where director Saverio Costanzo and executive producers Lorenzo Mieli and Jennifer Schuur appeared to offer some insight into the ambitious production. Below, key things to note about the production thus far.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">1) Not even the show’s director and producers have met Ferrante.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The famously elusive Ferrante, whose real identity remains unknown (“Elena Ferrante” is a pseudonym), has communicated with the production team only through mail, with Ferrante’s publisher acting as a go-between. “We have been mailing to each other since the beginning,” said director Saverio Costanzo. “I don’t know who she is… I am not curious to know, actually. She was writing with us from the beginning… she was collaborating a lot.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think it’s one of the best kept secrets in Italy’s history,” Mieli added. “There are many rumors, but nobody knows. And at the end of the day, nobody cares because [protecting her identity] is very important to her.”</p><img alt="Design, Event, Room, Night, Table, Games, Crowd, " title="Design, Event, Room, Night, Table, Games, Crowd, " width=2500 height=1667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1b235e3782cdf7effc3ddc384e79f17c968f077646ecd17634ce5c7dcff79a7d37ec750a49b75fea74f3d8c6714b1f75-1532642018.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Elisa Del Genio on set with director Saverio Costanzo.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">2) The show will be subtitled not only in America, but also in Italy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are a huge number of local and regional dialects spoken throughout Italy, and the Neapolitan dialect central to Ferrante’s novel is not widely understood, even by native Italian speakers. “We don’t understand the Neapolitan dialect,’ executive producer Lorenzo Mieli explained. “For us, we are Romans. We come from Rome, so we don’t understand at least 70 percent of the dialogues, even in Italian. So this show is going to be subtitled in Italian, too.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“One of the key things Ferrante does beautifully in her book is to use dialect to separate out class and education,” added executive producer Jennifer Schuur. “That was a big challenge, to try and create nuance for the worldwide audience. I think Italian speakers will grasp that nuance easily, but the challenge was… trying to translate that into English language.”</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">3) Casting the two generations of Elena and Lila was a “terrifying” challenge.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finding four young actresses with the skill and depth to embody these nuanced characters and the ability to speak in the correct Neapolitan dialect was no mean feat. “The casting process was about six, seven months,” Costanzo said. “We saw something like 8,000 kids, just in the area of Naples, because the [series] is in Neapolitan dialect, so we were looking for someone who really knows that dialect. The funny thing is that these four girls are the only option we had. It’s a miracle, somehow. We did not have a second choice.” Asked about the experience of casting such crucial roles under such specific limitations, Costanzo admitted “It was terrifying.”</p><img alt="Head, Nose, Eye, Reading, Street fashion, Book, Brown hair, Long hair, Publication, Love, " title="Head, Nose, Eye, Reading, Street fashion, Book, Brown hair, Long hair, Publication, Love, " width=5000 height=3333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/4733b745c4996ffbfea4a14215a9aee1d3622d952336e0375388fd33f25aac0e4bee3e464cdd24cab0d8617ce7a3fdec-1532641800.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Elisa Del Genio as young Elena and Ludovica Nasti as young Lila.</p><img alt="Face, Beauty, Cheek, Human, Eye, Friendship, Smile, Interaction, Photography, Darkness, " title="Face, Beauty, Cheek, Human, Eye, Friendship, Smile, Interaction, Photography, Darkness, " width=3149 height=1771 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-my-brilliant-friend-1532641948.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span><p>Margherita Mazzucco as teenage Elena and Gaia Girace as teenage Lila.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">4) There is a four-season plan for the show.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The eight-episode first season will cover the entirety of the first book in the series, My Brilliant Friend, and the plan is to dedicate one season to each of the following three novels, for a total of 32 episodes.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">5) Despite the specificity of its setting and language, the show tells a universal story.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Asked whether the show could have a broad appeal even for those unfamiliar with the books, Schuur responded: “I am not from Italy, I do not speak Italian. I’m American through and through. And when I read the books, there were so many things that I related to, as a small-town girl from outside of Seattle, about as far away from post-World War II Naples as you could get.” The visceral emotions Ferrante taps into throughout the series transcend borders, she added. “Violence is violence, love is love, loss is loss. Women’s struggle over time is women’s struggle over time.”</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">6) Naples has changed so dramatically since the 1950s that many of the show’s locations had to be built.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though the show was filmed entirely in Italy, very few parts of the city of Naples have been preserved from the period when the novels are set (a 50-year span beginning in the 1950s). “It was so difficult that we built a backlot,” Costanzo said. “What you saw in the trailer is built by us; the huge neighborhood that we built in Caserta, close to Naples. Naples is so changed that we couldn’t find any location that fits with the story in the fifties.”</p><img alt="Wall, Street, Human, Infrastructure, Road, Photography, Window, " title="Wall, Street, Human, Infrastructure, Road, Photography, Window, " width=2500 height=1667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/f8c59718c5078f43b6ebffb51a896a60a01bed7f435a94b30f224cac1d2bdebbfc701a44521c26c38e3c203592d5aa9e-1532642136.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">HBO</span></p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">7) HBO did not even consider making the series in English.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s impossible,” Costanzo said, revealing that during his and Mieli’s first meeting with HBO, their first question was “Is this story going to be in Neapolitan dialect?” He was impressed by the question, he said, and “shocked. I said ‘yes, but why do you care so much? For you it’s going to be with subtitles anyway.’ And she was like ‘Yeah, but we want something authentic.’ That was the first time I met them, and I understood without question why HBO is HBO.” Francesca Orsi, HBO’s co-head of drama, understood specifically that this story could not be told in anything other than Neapolitan dialect.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8672d2dc-5b2b-4ad4-bbfb-fd434da819c6.jpg alt="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" title="Headshot of Emma Dibdin" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Emma Dibdin is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles who writes about culture, mental health, and true crime.
