Beginning his acting career on Broadway with a role in the play The Firebrand of Florence in 1945, he has worked extensively in theatre acting and cinematic acting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-606 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite his hectic schedule, Boris has managed to strike the right balance between his career and personal life. After two failed marriages, he eventually discovered his perfect wife, with whom he has been happily married for nearly five decades.</p><p>Keep scrolling to find out more about his personal life.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Billy&nbsp;Dee Williams's Married Life</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Billy is a married person. In fact, he has married three times during his life, and two of those marriages ended up in divorce, with the third almost reaching the same fate if it wasn't for some reconciliatory actions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>So, let's start with Billy's first marriage. The Star Wars actor married Audrey Sellers in 1960. Not much is known about the relationship except for the fact that they had a son together. Corey Dee Williams, Billy's first-born, came into the earth in 1960.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, their relationship came to an end shortly after their marriage, although the exact date of their divorce is not known. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Read More:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Film Director Gareth Edwards Details On Wife Like Girlfriend Who Cares So Much</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>After his split with his first wife, Audrey, Billy tied the knot for the second time, this time to Marlene Clark. But, his relationship with his second wife wasn't meant to last for&nbsp;long, either. Subsequently, the couple divorced each other in 1971, just three years into their marital life. The ex-couple never had any children.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Later,&nbsp;Billy met his&nbsp;third and current wife, Teruko Nakagami. Billy and his wife, Teruko, have in common that they had been married before they met each other. His wife, Teruko, was married to jazz legend&nbsp;Wayne Shorter. She even had a daughter with Wayne named Miyaki.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Billy and his current wife, Teruko, got&nbsp;married on 27th December 1972 and have a daughter together. Hanako Williams, Billy's second-born child and third, including step-daughter Miyaki took birth in 1973. Hanako is now married, has children, and works as the manager for an art gallery in Los Angeles. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Looking at Billy's past marriage records, it wouldn't be surprising to say that he also faced some problems during his third marriage. Billy and his wife, Teruko, filed for divorce in 1993. But,&nbsp;the couple eventually decided to sort things out between themselves and reconciled their differences in 1997.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Billy and his wife are still together to this date. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><img alt="Billy Dee Williams's wife and grandson" height=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/Billy-Dee-Williams-with-Teruko-Nakagami2019.JPG width=398 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Billy Dee Williams with wife Teruko Nakagami and grandson Finnegan Ichiro at the&nbsp;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;premiere on 14th December 2015&nbsp;</strong>(Photo: Zimbio)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The actor is also a grandfather.

His to-be-released works include Star Wars: the Rise of Skywalker (2019) and Star Wars: Detours (TV series) - whose release date is yet to be announced.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Billy&nbsp;Dee Williams And The Star Wars Franchise</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Billy is famous for playing the iconic character of Lando Calrissian in the Star Wars universe.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was George Lucas'&nbsp;first choice to play Lando, and Billy did not disappoint as he&nbsp;made&nbsp;the character iconic. BIlly's first appearance in the Star Wars franchise came in the 1980 movie&nbsp;Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.
