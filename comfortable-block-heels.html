Due to the stress and pressure they can put on the feet — even the legs and back —&nbsp;they’re often considered a “style over comfort” footwear option. But not all are bound to leave you eager to kick them off at the end of the day. Enter the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>block heel</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Block heels are a great alternative to a stiletto, as they provide height without compromising stability,” explains Dr. Najwa Javed, podiatrist and founder of shoe label E’Mar. “The larger surface of the heel allows for better pressure distribution, which, in turn, means better balance as your foot sits in a high heel.” And the better the pressure distribution, the less likely you’ll be dealing with aches and pains in the heels, arches, or balls of your feet after just a few hours of wear. However, not all block heels are created equal, and plenty of other factors contribute to just how comfortable a pair will be — heel height, insole cushioning, and toe shape, to name a few. That’s why we consulted a team of experts ranging from podiatrists to designers and stylists to help us narrow down the list to only the most comfortable options on the market.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-ally-shoes-bold-blocks></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ally Shoes Bold Blocks</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ally Shoes Bold Blocks" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/x0R9YUF2vIA4UqS_gBI4sO1OkQM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ally-shoes-bold-blocks-b0c138f454df4a25b4b14f669e13a4c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ally Shoes</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This stylish 3-inch block-heeled pump boasts a three-point comfort system and is available in four different widths.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some sizes and widths take three to four weeks to ship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Every aspect of this pump by Ally Shoes was thoughtfully designed with comfort in mind, from heel to sole to upper, which is why we’re ranking it as our number-one pick. It features a stylish, ever-so-slightly angled 3-inch block heel, a height that many podiatrists consider comfortable enough for long wear, and a three-point comfort system that includes a patented internal support structure and an ergonomic padded insole with a deep heel cup and arch support. “It also has crest padding to prevent the foot from sliding to the front of the shoe throughout the day,” says podiatrist and Ally Shoes co-founder Dr. Roxann Clarke, an especially important feature for a pointed toe, which often results in smushing and pain. We also appreciate that it’s available in four different widths and crafted with a stretchy leather upper for a perfect fit, while supple suede lining gives it a luxurious hand feel (...foot feel?). Moreover, it comes in an impressive lineup of 27 colors, prints, and textures, so there’s truly an option for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Lambskin patent leather upper; Italian leather sole; and suede lining | <strong>Size: </strong>4–12, A–D widths | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>3 inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>27</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-raid-maya-block-heel-mary-janes></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Raid Maya Block Heel Mary Janes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Raid Maya Block Heel Mary Janes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gxP1pVuw_fMMPgOPGEB9NJHJ0Ow=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/raid-maya-block-heel-mary-janes-5f27861752f146399076712ca50b3bbf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ASOS</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The extra-wide block heel is comfortable and stable, while the adjustable strap provides extra support.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It doesn’t have footbed cushioning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Mary Janes have been enjoying a moment in the spotlight over the last few seasons, and this glitzy pair takes the trend to towering new heights. Upon first glance, they might seem like a tough-to-wear style — intimidating, even — but they’re actually quite stable and comfortable, something budget footwear options don’t always equate to. The exaggerated, extra-wide block heel provides great balance, while the platform sole takes some pressure off the arches and balls of the feet, positioning the foot at a more comfortable angle for walking and standing. The cross-vamp strap provides a more secure fit, further contributing to the shoe’s stability. Finished in a shiny patent material with a rhinestone-embellished buckle, they’re more of a statement shoe than an everyday heel — that is unless your sartorial taste leans more playful. Overall, they’re fun and functional, and when you consider the price point, they’re also a guilt-free purchase.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Synthetic and metal upper; polyester upper lining; synthetic inner lining; and thermoplastic outsole | <strong>Size: </strong>6–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>Not listed | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-gucci-horsebit-detailed-leather-pumps></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gucci Horsebit Detailed Leather Pumps</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gucci Horsebit Detailed Leather Pumps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sQuvdMpCz3s2DK6TQDpffuTiGhw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gucci-horsebit-detailed-leather-pumps-67e8a9dc9a374a84847949ca4598a3f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-A-Porter</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Polished and sophisticated, these block heels are just the right height and width for comfortable all-day wear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They don’t have footbed cushioning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These Gucci pumps are the epitome of quiet luxury, crafted with buttery-soft Italian leather and embellished with the fashion house’s iconic horsebit hardware detailing — recognizable, yes, but not nearly as in-your-face as, let’s say, an all-over double G logo. Exceptional quality and craftsmanship are to be expected, but more importantly, these shoes are actually comfortable. Most podiatrists consider 3 inches to be a comfortable heel height for all-day wear (more on that below), and considering this pair’s flared, extra-wide block heel, you can expect less pressure on your arches and forefoot. Plus, the squared toe also provides more wiggle room for toes than a pointed toe, which is another major plus — especially if you’re planning to wear these for a full day at the office.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Goat leather | <strong>Size: </strong>IT34–IT42 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>3 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-suede-loeffler-randall-nerine-suede-pumps></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Suede</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Loeffler Randall Nerine Suede Pumps</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Loeffler Randall Nerine Suede Pumps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cwUeYif7zEJfEHUq9nfL5_FoRbM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loeffler-randall-nerine-suede-pumps-5781386d4a794e4b9bc0b5503c5667ba.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-A-Porter</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These suede 2-inch pumps make a great everyday shoe that can be dressed up or down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The toe bed is somewhat narrow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a lot to love about these modest, mid-height pumps. Minimalist in design, they’re set on a comfortable 2-inch block heel with an elongated, softly squared toe for a polished and refined feel. They’re also crafted in a buttery black suede that’s quite versatile, pairing just as effortlessly with jeans and a tee as they can with tailored trousers or a sparkly mini dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also appreciate that they were made with ethical and mindful practices in mind: The brand itself is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">transparent</a> about its practices, and at least 50 percent of the tanneries it works with are rated by the Leather Working Group, a third-party organization that audits facilities on their environmental impact.

It doesn’t hurt that they’re also super on-trend right now — and if the Spring/Summer 2024 runways are any indication, they’ll continue to be through next year. Tory Burch, a brand having quite the renaissance of its own in recent seasons, does the square-toe right with these slingbacks, which feature an elongated, softer toe shape that’s more flattering than a harsher, retro-inspired square. Designed with a comfortable 2.25-inch angled heel, they're less prone to causing aches and pains, while the adjustable ankle straps provide extra support and stability, whether you’re wearing them to the office or for a night out. We also love the luxurious feel of the shiny patent finish and horsehead vamp chain detail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper, leather sole with rubber heel cap | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.25 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pointed-toe-emar-ari-block-heel-pump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pointed-Toe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>E’Mar Ari Block Heel Pump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="E&amp;acirc;Mar Ari Block Heel Pump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3gK1ungyiuPQW3v8ybdsKjI8Xt8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/emar-ari-block-heel-pump-e094da0a6ceb4b1bbc1e65b9ee01dd32.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>EâMar</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pointed toe features an accommodating, stretchy toe box for a truly comfortable fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The style runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike square toes, pointed-toe shoes have a reputation for being uncomfortable. They tend to be designed quite narrow, and when coupled with some height, the toes end up being pushed forward (and squished) in the pointed toe box, resulting in pain over time. That’s why we trust this pair from E’Mar, a comfort-forward footwear label designed by Dr. Javed. “These boast a wide-based 90-millimeter block heel for optimal support, while the extra-deep pointed toe box features a mesh upper that stretches to accommodate the toes,” she says. It’s also strategically designed with a 45-degree incline to evenly distribute pressure and contains cushy multilayer foam padding throughout. The best feature, however, is a carbon fiber orthotic — a durable, ultra-thin shock-absorbing layer that promotes proper alignment and optimizes foot biomechanics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Suede, leather, and mesh upper; leather lining and sole; EVA midsole; and carbon fiber orthotic mesh | <strong>Size: </strong>EU36–EU41 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>90 millimeters | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-inez-frida></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Inez Frida</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="INEZ Frida" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/O-o_WV21J_b0QALJk7Pg4X-ZMJ8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/inez-frida-f37d5ca0ea4647f5af75c4872e94440f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>INEZ</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This sleek mid-height pump comes in five beautiful colorways and is designed with comfort-forward features.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not offered in sizes smaller than 6.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This mid-height block heel pump from Inez is the perfect everyday work pump. Minimalist in design, it boasts plenty of comfort-forward features — a proprietary plush insole, arch support, a modest heel, a supersoft leather lining, and sizing in three different widths — that make these ideal for wearing all day long, even if you’ll constantly be on your feet. They’re crafted from luxe Italian leather and made in Spain, so you can expect superior quality and craftsmanship, too (which makes the price tag quite the steal).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The style is available in five colorways, all stunning in their own right. From the above gunmetal patent to croc-embossed olive and mocha, they’re all neutral enough to pair with just about anything in your closet. “I had workwear in mind when I designed this style,” says Inez creative director Hannah Spinelli. “The softly squared toe and 2.5-inch block heel are intended to complement tailored looks.

The lower heel and narrower toe also have an elongating effect, a flattering bonus for folks with wide feet. Overall, the shoe’s on-trend, minimalist design is versatile enough to be worn from day to night — and thoughtful design features ensure you can do so comfortably.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper, synthetic lining and sole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–13, narrow–wide | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.25 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-flat-feet-frankie4-juliett-ii-heel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Flat Feet</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frankie4 Juliett II Heel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frankie4 Juliett II" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ADqpXmd26-CFvUkae3k4-4n1Eds=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frankie4-juliett-ii-e2b84e60ac754aa8ac71dd5884ee8c5f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frankie4</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These slingback kitten heels feature a low block heel and plenty of support and cushioning, making them a solid choice for flat feet.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It’s not offered in sizes smaller than 6.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Javed, folks with flat feet often find higher heels more painful due to the amount of pressure they put on the balls of the feet and arches. “When buying heels for flat feet, keep it low, between 45 and 60 millimeters — about 1.75 to 2.5 inches. Chunky, wider heels are best, as they provide a slight elevation, protecting the arch without severe pressure in the ball of the foot,” she says. Proper arch support and cushioning are also something to look out for.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These slingbacks from podiatrist-designed brand Frankie4 feature a low, 1-inch block heel with a sleek, angular shape, making for a supremely comfortable (and stylish) choice for flat feet. But that’s not all: It’s designed with a built-in triple-layer support and cushioning system that helps alleviate foot pain throughout the heel, arch, and forefoot, while strategically-placed foam lining helps to alleviate pressure and rubbing on the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper, footbed cover, and lining | <strong>Size:</strong> 6–13 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>1 inch | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-high-arches-vivaia-square-toe-chunky-heels></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for High Arches</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vivaia Chunky Heels</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vivaia Square Toe Chunky Heels" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XbdZL_9vmkbt3YjsiwAYBFdTEzA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vivaia-square-toe-chunky-heels-1a54c5b3dcbe469eb4cfb5eabddc8c55.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vivaia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This stretchy mid-height heel features a cushy foam insole that provides heel rebound, arch, and forefront support.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Despite the fabric upper, they’re not machine washable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like flat feet, folks with high arches could also benefit from support and cushioning throughout the shoe — to be more precise, stabilizing mid-arch support as the arches tend to not touch the ground, and ample cushioning in the heels and balls of feet to absorb impact. The pressure-relieving diamond-padded insoles in these sophisticated block heels are a great choice for high arches, and we appreciate that the heel modestly measures under 2 inches for an even more comfortable fit. Also nice: The knit upper is nice and stretchy, and the toe is squared, ensuring ample room in the toe box and preventing toe pain over time. They come in a few different neutral hues, but we’re partial to this workwear-ready cap toe that can easily transition from the office to after-work drinks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Upcycled knitted upper, rubber outsole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>1.77 inches | <strong>Colors: </strong>12</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-peep-toe-calla-fern></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Peep-Toe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calla Fern</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calla Fern" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/YkEhSdibUshJ5tSbvqVJGWIySF4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/calla-fern-854295cb33cb4012a0e8a9b1b6498b25.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Calla</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These peep-toe sandals have a wider opening than traditional styles for a more comfortable fit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The size range isn’t very inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Peep-toe shoes are another style with a reputation for being uncomfortable, as the small opening at the toe (hence the “peep”) tends to be quite restricting, causing a lot of pressure and rubbing on the toes — something that can be extra uncomfortable for anyone dealing with bunions, or bony bumps that grow on the base of the big toes, or hammertoes, or toes with an abnormal middle joint bend. Shoe label Calla is designed with bunions in mind, so the toe opening is a bit wider, falling somewhere between classic open-toe sandals and traditional peep-toe styles. Couple that with a cushioned insole with arch support, a width that can accommodate extra-wide feet, and a stud-embellished heel, and you have a fun and functional party shoe made for dancing the night away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Kid leather upper and lining | <strong>Size: </strong>6–10 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.15 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sandal-sam-edelman-weylon-slide-sandal></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sandal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sam Edelman Weylon Slide Sandal</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sam Edelman Weylon Slide Sandal" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2rLVpf6Rmd4o4V1kP6E9TNIcE-A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sam-edelman-weylon-slide-sandal-0b090247c4c14cd091ff086bac6d9df0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A low and wide block heel makes this summery woven slide especially comfortable and stable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It doesn’t have footbed cushioning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no doubt that mules are on-trend for open-toe footwear, but they don’t offer ankle support like strappier styles. That’s why we appreciate the low and wide 2-inch heel and half-inch platform on this summery style from Sam Edelman, which helps to provide better balance and stability. Woven detailing makes for a breathable (and cute) warm-weather shoe, while the leather logo accent offers an air of luxury…minus the luxury price point. They come recommended by stylist Michaela Leitz, who counts them as both a versatile and stylish option. “The flared block heel and squared toe add a touch of modern flair to an otherwise classic style,” she says. “Pair them with anything from jeans to a flowy dress for an effortless look.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather and textile upper; synthetic lining; and rubber sole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-pump-vince-camuto-flaira-pump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Pump</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vince Camuto Flaira Pump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vince Camuto Flaira Pump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nKecCHZXw3dvhBzV5X7guFimcKI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vince-camuto-flaira-pump-ff92dd9b98da47a68bcea73c27d58b28.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DSW</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This modern twist on a classic pump boasts a wide, angular block heel that provides better comfort and stability.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The pointed toe is slightly narrow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These Vince Camuto pumps see the classic workwear style get a modern and practical upgrade. The angled block heel not only lends a stylish, sculptural touch, but it’s incredibly comfortable, too: Measuring in at a modest 2.38 inches, it prevents excess weight on the balls of the feet, while the wide, rectangular base ensures pressure is evenly spread throughout the foot. The statement heel shape also makes the style feel a little less stuffy, allowing for plenty of styling versatility and sartorial experimentation — they can just as easily be dressed up as they can dressed down. What’s more, the insole boasts a cushy padded footbed, giving us pumps we’d actually want to wear all day long. Factor in the reasonable price point, and they’re pretty much a no-brainer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper, synthetic lining and sole | <strong>Size: </strong>6–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.38 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-loafer-nomasei-trench-moccasins></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Loafer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nomasei Trench Moccasins</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nomasei Trench Moccasins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UOUyM3RySjtTYifuMpECXxUxgY4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nomasei-trench-moccasins-704d72bea9854b0b9fe5c3e5a8782b92.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nomasei</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This stylish square-toe loafer features a memory foam insole and a modest heel that adds height, sans pain.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This style runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However classic a loafer may be, there’s no denying its current hold on fashion. We have our eyes set on this versatile and practical heeled option from Nomasei which, style-wise, couldn’t be a more gorgeous shoe. It’s crafted from premium off-white semi-patent leather and a black stacked leather heel, complete with the brand’s signature hand emblem, making for a refreshing take on an otherwise simple shoe. Thoughtful design elements ensure that these heels not only look good but are good on the feet, too. Set on an extra-chunky, modest 6-centimeter (under 2.5-inch) heel and equipped with a cushy memory foam insole, they ensure stability as you run around town and won’t leave the balls of your feet aching by the end of the day (or the rest of your lower body, for that matter). What else would you expect from a brand founded by two Chloé alums?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Semi-patent calfskin exterior; goat leather insole/lining; and calf leather outsole/slats | <strong>Size: </strong>FR36–FR42 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>6 centimeters | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-metallic-sarah-flint-perfect-emma></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Metallic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sarah Flint Perfect Emma</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sarah Flint Perfect Emma" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HH5tHo6ZAQVcxTl9u-jpDhley7Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sarah-flint-perfect-emma-2abdd18d5cc341ceb2ece438d0c29ccb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sarah Flint</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Statement-making gold leather makes this otherwise simple style stand out.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This style runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s something about a metallic finish that can make even the humblest of shoe silhouettes stand out, which is why we’re eyeing the Perfect Emma from luxury, comfort-forward shoe label Sarah Flint. This playful style is designed with a golden Saffiano leather — AKA, one of the most durable leathers out there, ensuring years and years of wear — and a V-shaped vamp that exposes just the right amount of toe cleavage. Factor in the chunky 2-inch block heel, generous footbed padding, and anatomical arch support, and you have quite the comfortable everyday heel, fit for the office or running around town. It’s also designed with a widened toe box, ensuring the pointed toe won’t cramp toes or cause pain by the end of the day. While we’re clearly big fans of this stunning gold leather, this style is available in a handful of leather and suede colors and prints, should you prefer something a bit more subtle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Saffiano leather upper; leather lining and insole; and leather outsole with rubber forepart | <strong>Size: </strong>4–13 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mule-madewell-the-maccaro-mule></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mule</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell The Maccaro Mule</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Maccaro Mule" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tpFDbi6eAjt1uvJueGL4NcCAMUM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-the-maccaro-mule-3ece741e27a748378b10d7474e8ec669.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> These mules are the perfect balance of laid-back and polished, elevating even your most casual looks without sacrificing comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This style runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These chunky mules from Madewell strike the perfect balance between laid-back and polished, making for an extremely versatile and effortless shoe you can wear in a handful of sartorial situations. The easy, slide-on style may lean on the casual side, but the added height and shiny, chocolate brown finish have the ability to instantly elevate your most relaxed looks, even jeans and a tee. Despite adding almost 3 inches of height, the wide, stacked wood block heel ensures it does so sans aches and pains, while elastic gores ensure a comfortable fit (no vamp rubbing or blisters, here) and a rounded toe box provides the toes with enough wiggle room. And because mules don’t offer ankle support like pumps or slingbacks, we appreciate the higher vamp for added midfoot stability and balance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper and lining, leather sole with rubber heel cap | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.75 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mary-jane-reformation-max-block-heel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mary Jane</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Max Block Heel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Max Block Heel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8_TvCxsuDbjZVSKryxsXmINI9ZM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-max-block-heel-be340c9b7b7848d7b230996807dad4ef.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A chunky block heel offers comfortable height.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The style doesn’t have footbed cushioning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As Mary Janes continue to trend among the fashion set, you can expect to see plenty of variations of the style emerge, from grunge-inspired to classic school-girl. We love Reformation’s take, which leans more classic, is crafted in shiny patent leather, and is designed with a singular strap. Even so, it feels modern thanks to the addition of a chunky block heel that adds just the right amount of height (and, unlike our best budget pick, is a little more modest and practical for every day). Rounded toes and extra ankle security provide even more comfort and stability, making these a fun and functional upgrade from your usual day heels. We also appreciate Reformation’s transparency about its manufacturing practices, which includes listing each product’s carbon footprint — and this shoe leaves about 11 percent less than the average shoe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>50 millimeters | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-slingback-gentle-souls-by-kenneth-cole-dionne-pointed-toe-slingback-pump></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Slingback</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gentle Souls by Kenneth Cole Dionne Pointed Toe Slingback Pump</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gentle Souls by Kenneth Cole Dionne Pointed Toe Slingback Pump" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/v4gGMNrUHa7zOBdKwQsdJRKQN0E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gentle-souls-by-kenneth-cole-dionne-pointed-toe-slingback-pump-1609ddd5470d4a32b5768d13b24d4cbe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These comfy slingbacks are designed with a wider, stretchy ankle strap and memory foam cushioning.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The pointed toe is slightly narrow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Slingbacks are great for when you crave the open-back breathability of a sandal but still want coverage and security. But while slingback ankle straps provide stability, they can sometimes become uncomfortable on the heel, even causing blisters. That’s why we’re picking these pumps from Gentle Souls by Kenneth Cole, which are designed with a wider-than-average, non-buckled elastic strap for a snug fit sans digging. Set on a 2.75-inch heel, it’s designed with a cushy memory foam insole, and not just any memory foam — it’s made with Poron, a “smart foam” that boasts greater resiliency and longevity, meaning this shoe will continue to feel like walking on clouds for years to come. Design-wise, we love the modern feel of matte, monochromatic hardware, which lends a cool, modern touch to an otherwise classic, preppy design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper and lining, rubber sole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>2.75 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-boot-franco-sarto-penelope-square-toe-bootie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Boot</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Franco Sarto Penelope Square Toe Bootie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Franco Sarto Penelope Square Toe Bootie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IjoKORixVd6zmRyF0TTxMvOZQh4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/franco-sarto-penelope-square-toe-bootie-f9fe8b74d5294ba287b9c57d5986d40d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This square-toe boot features a cushioned footbed with arch support and a stretchy shaft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It only comes in cool-toned colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Heeled boots may provide more ankle support and stability than the average pair of pumps, mules, or sandals, but that doesn’t necessarily rule them out from killing our feet by the end of the day. That’s why we’re choosing these sleek, thoughtfully designed Franco Sarto booties as our top pick for the category. They not only hit all the trends with a squared toe, chunky sole, and sculpted blocked heel, but these features actually avert achiness in the heels and the toes (and everything in between) by creating more even pressure throughout the foot and preventing toe box crowding. And it doesn’t stop there: They’re designed with a padded insole and arch support for a secure yet cushy feel, and while the 7-inch shaft is on the taller side, the stretchiness of the leather provides a comfortable yet accommodating fit. Have your pick from a number of pretty, subdued hues (though we wish they came in brown!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Leather upper; textile lining; and synthetic sole | <strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>3.25 inches | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-platform-charles--keith-monique-ankle-strap-platform-pumps></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Platform</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charles & Keith Monique Ankle-Strap Platform Pumps</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charles &amp;amp; Keith Monique Ankle-Strap Platform Pumps" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_RlYgp1FukAO0wGHV5p889AwjkU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charles--keith-monique-ankle-strap-platform-pumps-b779c4c6579d46d3997bc1354fd3888f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charles & Keith</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>A chunky platform sole makes this pump stable and easy to walk in.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It doesn’t have footbed cushioning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we think of towering platform heels, the first word that comes to mind usually isn’t “comfort.” However, in many cases, they tend to be much easier to walk in than the average heel, as the forefoot platform actually negates the true height of the heel, positioning your foot at a much more comfortable angle, and the overall chunkiness tends to impart better balance and stability. This style from Charles & Keith is a great example, designed with an almost 3.5-inch heel that, in reality, ends up feeling more like 2 inches, a much more practical height for walking. We also appreciate how the daintiness of the ankle strap offsets the clunkiness of the platforms while also providing added stability and support. Take the trend-forward silhouette and reasonable price point into account, and it’s hard to resist clicking “add to cart.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Faux leather | <strong>Size: </strong>4–11 | <strong>Heel Height: </strong>8.5 centimeters | <strong>Colors:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Heel Thickness and Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A block heel is generally more comfortable than a stiletto, providing better stability, balance, and more evenly distributed pressure throughout the foot — but block heels come in varying shapes and thicknesses, and some styles are more comfortable than others. “A wider base, such as a square block-shaped heel, is preferable to a circular block or a triangular block,” says Dr. Javed. “The wider the shape, the better the pressure distribution and the less pressure on the foot.” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vince Camuto’s Flaira Pump</a> boasts an extra-wide rectangular heel shape for great stability and support.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Heel Height</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Heel height will always play a crucial role in a shoe’s comfort level, but in the case of block heels, you may be able to get away with wearing a taller heel than you’re used to. “It’s normal for someone to feel more stable in a block heel than in a slim heel at the same height — therefore, block heels are often a more comfortable choice, especially when wearing a heel over 3 inches,” explains Spinelli. Still, there are limits: “Anything higher than 4 inches can put increased pressure on the front of the foot and be uncomfortable, regardless of the shoe having a block heel,” Dr. Clarke says. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">ALLY Shoes’ Bold Blocks</a> hit that 3-inch sweet spot, but if you want a bigger height boost, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Charles & Keith’s Monique Ankle-Strap Platform Pumps</a> add almost 3.5 inches in height, comfortably, thanks to the chunky platform.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Proper Support and Cushioning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good indicator that a heel will be comfortable? It’s designed with proper support from heel to toe and features cushioned insoles to help reduce pressure on the heels and balls of the feet. “The phrase ‘beauty is pain’ should be banished from our vocabulary, especially when it comes to fashion,” says Leitz. “Always prioritize comfort — look for shoes with generous cushioning, supportive arches, and a toe box that doesn’t cramp your style or your toes.” All the shoes on this list have at least some of these features, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Frankie4’s Juliett II</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Naturalizer’s Karina Square Toe Pump</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Vivaia’s Square Toe Chunky Heels</a>. Additionally, Dr. Javed notes that ankle straps and sling-back styles can help better stabilize and support the ankle joint, reducing pressure on the lower leg as the foot sits in an elevated position.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Toe Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to toe box shape, some are more comfortable than others. As Spinelli points out, a pointed toe is classic, but “a snip toe or softly squared toe can also look professionally polished and offer a bit more room in the toe box.” Anything too narrow can lead to squished toes and pain down the road (or within just a few hours, depending). <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Inez’s Frida</a> has a softly squared toe, providing the sleekness of a pointed toe with the comfort of a square toe, while the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">E’Mar Ari Block Heel Pump</a> boasts a stretchy mesh toe box that’s extra accommodating despite its sharp silhouette.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What’s a comfortable heel height for block heels?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In general, the experts agree that 3 inches is typically the maximum comfortable heel height, and as Dr. Clarke explains above, anything above 4 inches (even if a block heel) will put excess pressure on the front of the foot, leading to discomfort. Still, that sweet spot of added height and comfort will vary from person to person. “Comfort can be highly personal — what works for one person might not work for another,” says Leitz. “Always remember to prioritize comfort and listen to your body. After all, the ultimate goal of fashion should be to empower us and make us feel our best, not to impose discomfort or pain.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do high heels impact the body?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">High heels may look great, but they can have some pretty detrimental effects, and not just on our feet. “High heels place your foot in a hyper-flexed position, causing increased pressure on the ball of your foot and tightening the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon, inverting your ankle, and buckling your posterior chain (calves, hamstring, and lower back),” says Dr. Javed. “Over time, this position increases toe box pressure, leading to the stretching of ligaments and tendons and the development of bunions and hammertoes. They also lead to ankle instability and chronic ankle sprains.” This is more of a risk if you already have weakness or rigidity in these areas. “That weakness is accentuated when wearing heels, so it’s important these weaknesses are addressed and rehabbed before wearing them for extended periods of time,” Dr. Clarke adds. That said, it’s important to find a supportive pair designed to evenly distribute pressure, has cushy footbed padding, and, overall, you feel comfortable wearing for hours on end.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, wearing heels has its positives, too: “The added height from heels can help improve posture.
