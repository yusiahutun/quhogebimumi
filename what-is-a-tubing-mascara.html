Our go-to mascara, which used to work wonders, just doesn’t deliver the results it once did. If we were younger, we might consider hopping on the lash extension bandwagon to compensate; but, as it is, lash extensions can feel too fussy and like too much work. So what’s a girl to do? Well, lucky for us, there’s a new formulation of mascara that women — especially those over 50 — are raving about called tubing mascara. What is tubing mascara? It works like a lash extension without, well, the lash extension. Keep reading to discover the benefits of these new the easy-to-wear, easy-to-remove wonders, why it’s a miracle-in-a-tube for women over 50 and what we think are the very best tubing mascaras of 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is a tubing mascara?</h2><p>Tubing mascara gets its name from the way it works: It’s made to wrap around the lashes and dry into a rubbery, no-smudge “sleeve “tube” that slips off when broken down with warm water. That’s all thanks to special polymers that “coat each individual lash, giving a bit more noticeable separation,” explains celebrity makeup artist <a href=# rel=noopener>Lauren O’Leary,</a> whose work can be seen on famous clients like Niki Taylor.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Even better, says celebrity makeup artist <a href=# rel=noopener>Jamie Greenberg</a>, founder of <a href=# rel=noopener>JamieMakeup</a>, who has worked with stars like Kaley Cuoco and Rashida Jones, “most tubing mascaras are considered water resistant and optimize the length and volume of your lashes without all the clumping involved.” They also don’t smear if you rub your eyes — they simply roll off your lashes!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why tubing mascaras work well for women over 50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-501788038.jpg><li><strong>They’re smudge-proof:</strong> Tubing mascara is less likely to smudge, which can be helpful when you have fine lines, wrinkles or oily eyelids, preventing the “raccoon eyes” effect. What’s more, says New York-based makeup artist <a href=# rel=noopener>Lisa Pimentel</a>, whose work has appeared on fashion runways and the pages of magazines, “they’re also great for people with age-related dryness of the eyes, as they don’t flake and get into the eyes.”</li><li><strong>Removal is a cinch: </strong>Tubing mascaras are known for their easy removal. They typically come off with warm water and gentle pressure, as opposed to other mascaras that may require tugging, so lashes don’t get pulled out in the process. Plus, adds Pimentel, it’s a gentler option for those with sensitive eyes or those who may have difficulty with traditional makeup removers.</li><li><strong>They’re long-lasting:</strong> This ensures your lashes look long, thick and lush all day without the need for frequent touch-ups.</li><li><strong>They don’t clump</strong>: You can build up the volume and length of your lashes without the formula clumping or looking heavy. This can help create a more youthful and wide-eyed appearance without the mess.</li><li><strong>They’re gentle on lashes: </strong>Tubing mascaras are often formulated to be gentle on lashes, which can be important as lashes may become more delicate with age, explains Pimentel. They can help prevent breakage.</li><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to apply and remove tubing mascara</h2><p>O’Leary says to apply tubing mascara just like you would normal mascara. The only difference: “It does tend to dry down quickly so I typically recommend doing one eye, then the other and not jumping back and forth between coats.” Greenberg adds, “I always recommend wiggling your brush a little to help grab every lash, as well.”&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes time to removal, Pimentel says you can “remove gently with a washcloth and warm water — no soap or eye makeup remover needed!”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The 10 Best Tubing Mascaras</h2><p>Like regular mascara, tubing mascara is not a one-size-fits all. Read on to find the one that will best suit your needs.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1.
