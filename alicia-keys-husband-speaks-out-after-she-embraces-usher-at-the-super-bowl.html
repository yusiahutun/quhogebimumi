He brought out a long list of guests, including Ludacris, Alicia and H.E.R. However, his interaction with the Girl On Fire singer on stage had people talking, especially since the news broke yesterday he tied the knot with his girlfriend Jennifer Goicoechea. Alicia’s husband has now had his say on their eye-catching performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alicia-keys-husband-reacts-to-her-performance-with-usher-at-the-super-bowl>Alicia Keys’ husband reacts to her performance with Usher at the Super Bowl</h2><p>During the 2024 halftime show, the <a href=#>celebrity</a> sang a long list of his biggest hits including Yeah!, Love in This Club, U Got It Bad, and Burn.

During My Boo, 45-year-old Usher stood behind Alicia, 43, and held her close to him as they sang.</p><p>Despite fans being shocked by the gesture, Swizz didn’t seem to have a hunch about another man cradling his wife. Instead, he praised Alicia and Usher for the show they managed to pull off.</p><p><strong>AWKWARD: <a href=#>Kanye West’s Yeezy commercial had no budget after he ‘spent it all’ on Super Bowl spot</a></strong></p><p>Sharing three pictures, including one of his wife sitting at a piano while on stage and another of her with Usher to Instagram, he wrote: “Y’all talking about the wrong damn thing !!! Y’all don’t see that amazing dress covering the entire stadium,” and added several emojis including laughing faces and a lightening bolt emojis.</p><p>“Tonight’s performance was nothing but amazing with 2 amazing Giants! Congrats @usher and my love @aliciakeys that song is a classic [white heart emoji]. We don’t do negative vibes on this side, we make history [peace sign emoji]. Go see GIANTS at @brooklynmuseum it’s open until July blessings [numerous praying hands emojis].”</p><p>Alicia and Swizz have been married since 2010. They share two children: Egypt Daoud, 13, and Genesis Ali Dean, 9. Swizz has three older children from previous relationships.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-react-to-their-steamy-performance>Fans react to their steamy performance</h2><p>Underneath the 45-year-old’s post, arguments galore ensued. People were sharing how they would feel if they were Alicia Keys’ husband and had to watch her be hugged like that by Usher.</p><p>“You a better man than me cuz I woulda break the damn TV,” said one person.</p><p>Another penned: “That man was all over ur wife & this ur answer? They literally made a fool out of u. She must be the breadwinner to ok that.”</p><p>A third wrote: “You posted a pic with another man holding your girl. Imagine???????”</p><p>Others defended the two chart toppers and pointed out they were putting on a show for the audience.</p><p>One user commented: “Absolutely!! A man supporting his woman, not dimming her light or making her feel small, is a secure man! Love to see it!”</p><p>A second quipped: “That’s a king for his queen [crown emoji].”</p><p>Someone else agreed: “Love a secure man cuz y’all others be so insecure.
