class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These won’t be the only differences audiences who have previously seen The Lion King might notice: small tweaks over the decades have brought the show up to speed with a modern audience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taymor set the ball rolling by flipping Rafiki’s gender (originally male) and elevating the importance of the lionesses, while scenes have been streamlined and the running time chiselled down slightly in line with audiences’ reduced attention spans, says David Kreppel, associate music supervisor of The Lion King’s international tour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Theatre evolves over time. Our attention spans have got probably a little bit shorter. So the show has been paced just a little bit differently. Twenty years ago tempos, for example, in the show were a little bit slower because everybody kind of functioned a little bit slower. So [this show is] a combination of keeping very faithful to the original and just adjusting it slightly,” he says.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">The stage is expansive, but very simple. The themes are enormous, but [instead of] tonnes of sets, we have big bold statementsDavid Kreppel, associate music supervisor of The Lion King’s international tour</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During moments of comic relief delivered by meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa, the script has incorporated Mandarin slang, Chinese food references, “xie xie ni” (thank you) and an expression of surprise – “Wa!” – to tickle the Taiwanese audience. During its original run in China in 2006, the company went a step further, with the cast singing songs and interacting with the audience in Chinese.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong audiences will be given similar local “surprises”, the international tour’s resident director Omar Rodriguez says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This show has a different energy in every city and every country, because we work together to get a sense of the culture of that country.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/22/06729e90-0b48-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_1320x770_164101.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its debut in Taipei in July, in the same week Disney released its remake of the movie, could have been over-saturation for the franchise, but the show’s producers were confident the new film’s power could only be a good thing for the stage version. Although critics griped about the lack of expression in the characters compared to the original cartoon, the remake became the fastest animated film to gross US$1 billion, beating any previous Disney production, and the seventh-highest grossing movie ever.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has taken more than two decades for the musical to land in Hong Kong, but it comes at a time of nostalgia for Disney’s ’90s “golden era”, and The Lion King is the jewel in a crown studded with classics. With millennials who enjoyed Disney films as children starting their own families, the company is cashing in by churning out both live-action and CGI remakes of its legacy animations with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Mulan</span></a> , The Little Mermaid, and a 101 Dalmatians spin-off focusing on villain Cruella De Ville in the works.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It's the same reason people go see Shakespeare for hundreds of years,” says Kreppel. “It's a familiar story with a slightly different point of view; faithful to the original with slight differences. So anybody who loves The Lion King is going to love all its incarnations.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">A history of The Lion King musical, coming to Hong Kong</span></p></a></h3>In an age of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">virtual reality and digital wizardry</span></a>, The Lion King remains defiantly analogue, using natural materials to create mechanical sets and costumes that bring the Serengeti plains in Africa and their diverse flora and fauna to life. Actors operate masks, puppets and headpieces while emoting with their faces and gestures. This was inspired by puppetry traditions in Asia that Taymor came across during his four years studying theatre in Indonesia and Japan in the late ’70s.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They could have turned everything into an LED screen experience,” Kreppel says. “They didn't because so many of the truly magical storytelling moments are ancient: tears coming out of a mask will always be beautiful. The stage is expansive, but very simple. The themes are enormous, but [instead of] tonnes of sets, we have big bold statements.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kreppel cites Japanese theatre, and Indonesian theatre with its various forms of mask work, and wayang golek (rod puppets) and his knowledge of Chinese puppets, and Indian, and French ombre chinoise (shadow play), which originated in China, as inspiration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/22/4eb352d4-0b49-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_972x_164101.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In The Lion King, audiences see leaping antelopes, circling birds, snarling lions, slinking cheetahs, swaying giraffes, bowing zebra, scurrying mice, lumbering elephants and stampeding wildebeest all animated and controlled by cast members, creating a feast for the eyes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of the 200 puppets used in the show, the lions hold the gaze for the longest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Mufasa, Simba and the lionesses wear masks elevated above the actors’ faces, Scar is brought to life as an articulated hollow costume controlled with snarling energy by performer Anthony Lawrence. Though Simba and his father have symmetrical, kingly masks to demonstrate their morality, the costume of Mufasa’s outcast brother is jagged and hollow, and worn alongside a rib cage corset.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/22/0e7f4098-0b48-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_1320x770_164101.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having both the animal and human’s face visible at the same time creates Taymor’s concept of the “double event”, whereby creature-like movement and human expression combines to form a character.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You get the sense of the animal, as well as the humanity of the character,” Rodriguez says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In Rafiki, for example, you will see the baboon with the make-up and the feet. In the rest of the body, you will see the humanity, the spiritual leader. The storytelling and the physicality is really important in this show,” he adds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shaw, who plays Simba, says: “The movement, inspired by Japanese theatre, allows the puppet to marry with the body. With a tilt of your face, the whole puppet moves along with it. We're constantly reminded to explore how our bodies can move like lions. That helps to bring the costume and mask alive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/22/4da1ecd4-0b49-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_1320x770_164101.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For a story designed to entertain children, its creators go to great lengths to justify its themes and relevance to modern society, and pry apart the layers of allegory and moral messages within the tale, which has been likened to William Shakespeare’s Hamlet in its story of princes and plotting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rodriguez explains: “It's about the emotion; it's about humanity. And I think that's why this show is timeless. Because humanity never gets old. It is always present … The main reason we are telling this story is to share with people that we are humans, and that's why The Lion King is so important and so great.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It reminds us what we are, it doesn't matter what shape, colour or religion or whatever you have: you're a human.
