The man who played Jack Shephard in the successful television series. Matthew Fox is an American actor who has appeared in about ten feature films, but his more prominent acting roles have been seen on television.</p><p>This outstanding actor has been nominated for numerous awards, of which he has won a handful. In 2010 he received the Scream Awards for Outstanding Television Performance and before that he had won the Saturn Awards, the Screen Actors Guild, and the Satellite Awards. Come with us and let’s catch up on this fox a little bit…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matthew Fox Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p>Matthew Fox was born on July 14, 1966, and went to Deerfield Academy for a year as a postgraduate, graduating in 1984. For college, he attended Columbia University and graduated with a B.A. in Economics in 1989.</p><p>Nothing in Matthew Fox’s upbringing indicated that he wanted to be an actor, but he ended up there anyway. At the age of 25, Matthew Fox made his acting debut in an episode of Wings. In the same year, he played the lead role in a short-lived drama series, Freshman Dorm. Although he was given roles, he was not a familiar face on the small screen and was therefore repeatedly cast in supporting roles before he made his first appearance on the big screen in My Boyfriend’s Back in 1993.</p><p>In 1994, Matthew Fox was cast in one of the most prominent roles of his career when Charlie Salinger, the oldest of five siblings who lose both parents in a car accident in the 1990s teen drama Party of Five, was killed. It was a show that produced other stars including Scott Wolf, <a href=#>Jennifer Love Hewitt</a>, Lacey Chabert, and Neve Campbell. In 1996, People Magazine named him one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Eoin Macken Wife, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Is He Gay?</a></strong></p><p>Before receiving his second prominent role, Fox starred in another television series, Haunted 2002, after a Party of Five was canceled after the sixth season. From September 2004 to May 2010, Fox starred Dr. Jack Shephard in the critically acclaimed favorite series, Lost. He had originally auditioned for the role of James Ford, but J.J. Abrams, the series’ co-founder, felt he was better suited for the role of Jack. Fox was nominated for a Golden Globe for the role, won the Satellite Award in 2005, and shared the 2006 SAG Award for outstanding ensemble performance in a drama series for his role in Lost.</p><p>Fox, who declared after “Lost” that he was done with television shows, has since appeared in several films. In 2006, he starred in the sports drama We Are Marshall with Matthew McConaughey and had a brief appearance in the 2013 film World War Z starring Brad Pitt.</p><p>While his acting career may have stalled, Matthew finds his other passion for photography. A bonus disc released along with The Complete First Series of Lost featured “The Art of Matthew Fox,” which featured pictures he took of the cast and crew while on set.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Matthew Fox Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The value of Matthew Fox is currently estimated at $20 million. The wealth of the actor-photographer is said to stem primarily from his performances and commercially successful projects such as Lost and Party of Five.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Wife, Kids, and Family</strong></h2><p>The actor is currently married to his wife Margherita Ronchi and they have two children. When Fox’s acting career was on the run, he married his long-time girlfriend Margherita Ronchi in 1992. Ronchi was born in Italy and studied at Columbia University, where the couple met. The couple is proud parents of a daughter, Kyle, and a son, Byron.</p><p>Matthew Fox is the son of Loretta B. and Francis G. Fox, the great-great-great-grandson of Union General, George Meade. While his father came from a very blue-blooded Pennsylvania family of predominantly English descent, his mother was a mixture of Italian, British and Irish descent.</p><p>At the age of one, he moved to Wyoming with his parents and two siblings. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father, who used to work as a consultant for an oil company, bred longhorn cattle and horses and grew barley for the Coors beer company.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Sasha Alexander, Why Did She Leave NCIS, What is Her Net Worth?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Height and Body Measurement</strong></h2><p>The fame of Matthew Fox in the heyday of his career was based as much on his appeal as on his appearances in successful television shows. The actor was named one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world by People Magazine in 1996. The 1.82-meter tall actor weighs 81 kg, has dark brown hair and light brown eyes. He has gained some fat but lost it last for his role in Alex Cross in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqLA06GcsGWWpMVuw8ifnGajmZnAbrLApqClsV2WtKZ5x56goKCkYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-or-nah-the-weeknd-remix-by-the-weeknd.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Or Nah (The Weeknd Remix) by The Weeknd</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-worlds-heaviest-man-shows-551lb-weight-loss-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Former world's heaviest man shows off 551lb weight loss</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
