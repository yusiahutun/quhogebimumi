Jason, 36, had tears in his eyes during the press conference, which was attended by his younger brother,<strong> Travis Kelce</strong>, and their mom, <strong>Donna Kelce</strong>.</p><p>“He sounds more upset that he’s leaving his friends,” Joy said of Jason’s retirement announcement. “When I leave this show, it will not be because I’m worried about my future. It’ll be because I will miss my friends. That’s basically it.”</p><p><strong>Sunny Hostin</strong> grabbed onto Joy’s hand while <strong>Sara Haines</strong> gave her costar a hug after she made the <a href=#>very candid confession</a>. “I love when you say that,” Sara, 46, said.</p><p><strong>Alyssa Farah Griffin</strong> also chimed in, saying, “The good news is you can never leave us.”</p><p>Ahead of her 80th birthday, Joy previously explained that she had no immediate plans to <a href=#>leave The View</a>.</p><p>“I just signed a contract so I’ll be here for a while,” she told People in October 2022. “I have no plans to retire.”</p><p>Joy is currently the longest-sitting host on The View. She joined the daytime talk show in 1997 as one of the original panelists.</p><p>“I’m happy to be a part of it. So no, I’m not going anywhere. I’m having a good time,” she shared.</p><p>Joy previously left the show in 2013, but came back in 2015.</p><p>“I was glad to be fired,” she told Time Magazine in July 2022. “I basically was sick of the show at that point for some reason, I don’t even remember why.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/joy-behar-breaks-down-while-talking-about-leaving-the-view.jpg><p>While she’s had some tense discussions with her costars during the episodes over the years, she was ultimately delighted to be welcomed back to The View with open arms.</p><p>“Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in,” she said in a statement upon her return. “And I’m looking forward to sticking my two cents into the hot topics.”</p><p>It looks like viewers don’t have to worry about Joy retiring anytime soon.</p><p>“It’s really, you know, something that is an important show in many ways,” the comedian explained. “Sometimes I don’t believe that, as I’ve been here since the beginning, but we’re the most-watched show in daytime. Most-watched!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jprJlkpq1or6Mm6memZuoeqW71qdksKCZobJusMismq6ro567qHnLnpivoZ6cerW0xGatop2nZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leslie-bryans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leslie Bryans - Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./could-virtual-reality-trips-replace-real-travel-vr-headset.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Could virtual reality trips replace real travel?
