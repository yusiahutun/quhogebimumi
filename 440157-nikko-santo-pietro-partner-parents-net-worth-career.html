However, a few details about his early life are public. For example, he grew up in Los Angeles with his parents and younger sister, Gigi Santo Pietro.</p><p class=align-left>Nikko also has an older half-sister, Andrea Santo Pietro. She is the daughter of George Santo Pietro, from his first marriage with Linda Evans. Nikko would also have grown up with an elder sibling, but unfortunately, his mother had a miscarriage two years before he was born.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b4c620763443508a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Trinidad Valentin: nationality, Saweetie, family, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nikko and his sister enjoyed a happy childhood. Unfortunately, their parents' marriage did not last, and they divorced in 2002 when Nikko was just eight years old. After the divorce, they were primarily raised by their mother, Vanna, who focused on them and her career.</p><p class=align-left>After graduating from <a href=#>high school</a>, Nikko Santo Pietro enrolled at The University of Arizona.

At Oregon State, he pursued a Degree in Agriculture Sciences – a course based on his hobby (gardening).</p><h2>Nikko Santo Pietro's career</h2><p class=align-left>What does Vanna White's son do? He is a chef by profession. He started cooking as a hobby but has somehow turned it into a successful <a href=# title>business</a>. Through his social media, he advertises his cooking skills, especially when it comes to baking bread.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>The star</a> runs an online bakery brand, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nikko’s Bread</a>, where fans and other customers can place orders. Aside from working as a chef, Nicholas has also put his agriculture degree to use by working in the produce industry.
