Or maybe you never left — but we can all agree dressing for the office can be difficult. There’s a fine line between looking polished and frumpy, and finding work clothes is infinitely harder when you’re petite. (Hello, no one wants to spend extra time and money getting every item hemmed!)</p><p>Whether your office is casual or more buttoned-up, a good work pant can take your wardrobe far. We love the versatility of a pant that can be worn as part of a power suit for a big pitch, transitioned to the bar for happy hour, or dressed down with a t-shirt for casual Friday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve researched the best petite work pants out there so you don’t have to. To make our selections, we consulted some of our favorite petite fashion experts as well as tried several pairs (the author stands just 5 feet tall, so we’ve got plenty of experience buying petite pants of our own!). We looked for styles that match our petite portions, elongate our frames, don’t wrinkle, and you guessed it, don’t have to be hemmed.

Dressing them up or down is a breeze, and the short length fits petite frames well. Digital creator Kas Kay loves this silhouette, adding, “it's definitely an investment, but I love the quality and material.” We’d give an honorable mention to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">cropped length</a>, which comes in fewer colors but shows off flat shoes.</p><p>The pants are high-waisted and have a wide-leg that isn’t too flared, giving you a streamlined silhouette that elongates your legs. In our experience, these pants run on the small side (the author has a curvy/athletic body type and had to return her usual size for one size up). However, we found these to be incredibly comfy. The crepe fabric is smooth, soft, and silky, which is great for all-day wear. We think out of all of the pants on this list, the Effortless Pant strikes the perfect balance among quality, fit, feel, and price — not to mention, the silhouette is incredibly on-trend yet classic enough not to go out of style.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 00-16<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 28 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 13</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-quince-ultra-stretch-ponte-straight-leg-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince Ponte Straight Leg Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quince Ultra-Stretch Ponte Straight Leg Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/q628AGWHcX5t6LfuLA8eK6_gtZ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Quince-Ultra-Stretch-Ponte-Straight-Leg-Pant-ae288b6514014758ba7f12275b12d0e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants offer incredible quality for the price.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The size range leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Quince is a direct-to-consumer retailer that might not be a household name yet, but their pants sure have made an impression. The brand is able to offer high-quality essentials for less by white-labeling products and cutting out the middleman. We’ve shopped all kinds of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>products from Quince</a> and found that across the board, the quality holds up to their claims.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from wrinkle-resistant materials, these pants have a comparable feel to some of our higher-end picks, but they’re under $40, so you don’t have to break the bank when you’re on the clock. The straight leg silhouette offers a classic look that works for a variety of office dress codes. This pair features a pull-on elastic waistband and four-way stretch that’s as comfortable as your workout leggings, yet the subtle pocket details and belt loops signify that these pants mean business. While the pants come in three different inseams, the sizing only goes up to XL, which leaves a huge gap where we’d like to see more inclusivity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> XS-XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Rayon, nylon, spandex | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 28 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-j-crew-petite-wide-leg-essential-pant-in-italian-city-wool-blend></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.

Crew is an InStyle go-to for polished pieces, like these gorgeous pants. They feature crisp pleats, cuffed ankles, and a slightly wide leg — a recipe for a sharp look. While we love the combination of pleats and a slightly looser leg, the silhouette adds volume to your bottom half, so if you are looking for a slimming pair of pants, consider styles like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Spanx The Perfect Pant, Hi-Rise Flare</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Crafted with a blend of Italian wool, these trousers are well worth the splurge. You might think of wool as stiff and scratchy, but these pants are made of a luxe wool blend that’s comfortable even after hours at a desk. Plus, wool doesn’t wrinkle easily. The trousers are also the perfect length for petites, no hemming required. Petite sizing only goes up to 12 for these pants, which isn’t as inclusive as we’d like. We’ll note that the classic length goes up to size 24, so you can still buy these in plus-sizes, but they may require alterations. Still, we think these are a staple that’s well worth the investment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00-12<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Polyester, wool, elastane | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 27 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-eloquii-the-ultimate-stretch-suit-pintuck-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ELOQUII The Ultimate Stretch Suit Pintuck Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ELOQUII The Ultimate Stretch Suit Pintuck Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/06VJ-UC-xmbs25BgzG-cquvxhF4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eloquii-the-ultimate-stretch-suit-pintuck-pant-1089f0e64cf94cad9f55160fbeee2711.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ELOQUII</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants are size-inclusive and look so professional.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some reviewers feel the fabric is too thick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This suit pant has a classic, beautifully tailored look and feel. They’re made of a stretch ponte fabric that’s comfortable but looks deceivingly high-end — especially when worn with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching blazer</a>. Hitting at the ankles, these pants show off your shoes, whether that’s flats, sneakers, or heels. A subtle center pleat outlines your legs without adding bulk in the front. The slanted pockets on the sides as well as the welt pockets in the back also keep everything smooth and streamlined while still being functional. These pants perfectly show off your figure in a polished, work-appropriate way.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the brand claims the mid-weight fabric suits all seasons, some reviewers find the fabric too thick for warmer months. If you want a more breathable style, consider a linen blend pant, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maeve's Cropped Pants</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>14-28<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Rayon, nylon, spandex | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 25 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curvy-abercrombie--fitch-curve-love-sloane-tailored-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curvy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Curve Love Sloane Tailored Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie Curve Love Sloane Tailored Pants " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/w2CKO7AkibJlzLVgj01FdTOwKj4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/abercrombie-curve-love-sloane-tailored-pants-14d0bd0d70854b72bd90f926c95dca6c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pants achieve the rare feat of fitting petite yet curvy proportions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The fabric doesn’t feel as high quality as we’d like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Abercrombie’s Sloane pant is hands-down the author’s favorite pant because the brand’s short inseam is the perfect length (especially if you’re all torso and no legs!). Yet the brand takes it even further by offering a curve fit. Anyone who is curvy knows the struggle of finding bottoms that fit both their waist and their hips. Abercrombie aims to solve that problem by adding 2 extra inches through the hip and thigh area, so you don’t have to size up to fit your curves.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The entire internet was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>obsessing over these trousers</a> and even our own fashion writers are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fans</a>. Kay also loves these pants because they don’t need alterations and completely transformed her work outfits. Stylist Kim Johnson agrees, noting, “this Curve Love version will give you that perfectly fitting waist while also getting that loose and effortless fit in the leg.” Because of the relaxed-but-polished fit, these pants are versatile enough to dress up for the office or to rock a Scandinavian influencer off-duty look.</p><p>At less than $100, we don’t expect these pants to offer the most luxurious materials, and we have to admit the polyester blend feels thicker and slightly scratchy. Yet after owning several pairs, we can confirm the fabric is quite durable despite being low maintenance. We can throw them into the washer and dry them on low without shrinking the pants or ruining their shape. This is a trade off we don’t mind making.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23-37<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Polyester, viscose, elastane | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 28 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 18</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-spanx-the-perfect-pant-hi-rise-flare-black></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx The Perfect Pant, Hi-Rise Flare</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx The Perfect Pant, Hi-Rise Flare, " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RKn6fCtEAnavUUqtjOJ860oMy30=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Untitleddesign80-646854ffcdce4d748e3f573c88f57e3c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants have a comfortable pull-on design, so they’re practically like leggings.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The petite length is designed for 5’4” and under, so shorties may still need these hemmed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are another one of Johnson top picks for work pants. “I have the Hi-Rise Flare and the fit is unmatched,” she says. “The soft material is super comfortable and of course, because it’s Spanx, we know these will be super flattering.” True to the brand’s core ethos, the pants offer smoothing and sculpting around your waist as well as lift your booty. Not to mention that the high-rise and flared leg optically elongate your figure. Add in the fact that the design features no bulky buttons, zippers, or pockets, and these pants create one long, lean look. We also love how the style comes in two different shades of black to best go with the rest of your work attire. And did we mention they are machine washable?</p><p>Per the brand, these pants are designed to be worn with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work heels</a>, so they may run a bit long if you’re on the shorter side, or if sneakers are your work shoe of choice. Despite being stretchy and comfortable, the fabric is also a bit too heavy for hot summers (unless your commute is short and your office is heavily air-conditioned). But that aside, these are one of the most flattering options out there and are sure to become your go-to work pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS-3X<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Rayon, nylon, elastane | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 30 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-pockets-everlane-tencel-way-high-taper-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with Pockets</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Tencel Way-High Taper Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane Tencel Way-High Taper Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/07kXkds1YrbGsHGfMXbb2UW7xL0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-tencel-way-high-taper-pant-8da80a7f114b42b79a18b2ca64835042.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants have roomy pockets and the perfect ankle length.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The waistband doesn’t have a lot of stretch.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re obsessed with the relaxed-but-tailored fit on these pants. While they aren’t specifically made for petites, these pants have a cropped length and at 27 inches long, they will perfectly fit most people within the 5’1”-5’4” range. NY-based stylist Allie McKenna recommends Everlane’s options because they have a fairly inclusive size range and carry great pieces for a business casual dress code.</p><p>We love that these have a “borrowed from the boys” look and can be dressed up or down. The ankle length makes these the perfect pant to have fun with your shoes, whether that’s a bright sneaker, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>classic loafer</a>, or a little heel. And of course, we can’t forget the pockets, which come in handy when you’re running out to grab lunch or need to stash extra items for a meeting. The waistband is very structured and doesn’t allow for a ton of stretch, so you may want to size up for greater comfort.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00-16<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Lyocell, cotton | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 27 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skinny-loft-petite-sutton-skinny-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skinny</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LOFT Petite Sutton Skinny Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="LOFT Petite Sutton Skinny Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/woeXlnlOuQ4JVXB8vczELbuoxQA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loft-petite-sutton-skinny-pants-0ee2bb23c0834945b8b0964456e7505a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>LOFT</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants have the perfect cropped skinny fit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> These pants run small, so you may have to order a few different sizes to find the right fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wide-leg pants are a dime a dozen these days, but it’s harder to find a good skinny pant. If you prefer to wear pants that are more fitted through the leg, these ones are a great option. The body-skimming skinny fit is classic, and we love that these pants have an extra-cropped length that’s actually ankle-length on petites. Similar to the style from Spanx, these pants feature sculpting pockets which keep you secure even when drinks turn into dinner. Made from cotton and elastane, these bottoms are both breathable and stretchy.

McKenna highly recommends this pair because aside from being a quality pant, it comes in a variety of colors to allow for some fun styling options. These pants have a fitted waist and relaxed leg that’s not too wide and has just the right amount of drape. The fabric is lightweight enough to be worn in summer but tough enough to stand up to fall and winter office days. Did we mention that the fabric is lyocell, which wrinkles less than other options, so you’ll never have to worry about ironing when you really need to get out the door for work?</p><p>Another plus is that Reformation is a certified carbon neutral brand and is aiming to remove more emissions than they produce by 2025, which is a mission we can get behind. The downside of these pants is that the inseam is nearly 30 inches — far too long for some extra-petite women. Fortunately, Reformation offers <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">free alterations</a> either in-store or online, so you can ensure the right fit without any additional costs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0-12<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Lyocell | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 29.75 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 11</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tapered-madewell-petite-pleated-tapered-leg-pants-in-easygoing-crepe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tapered</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell Petite Pleated Tapered-Leg Pants in Easygoing Crepe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell Petite Pleated Tapered-Leg Pants in Easygoing Crepe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/WwbKkM_VLNliY3wZIPPVPu3dc9I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-petite-pleated-tapered-leg-pants-in-easygoing-crepe-5a334beafda64a988559223f72d9e579.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants are relaxed and super comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This pair runs large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Madewell is one of McKenna’s favorite size-inclusive brands — and these pants are a perfect example of a style that comes in extended sizing and lengths. We love this silhouette, which gives off "cool girl in charge" vibes. The wrinkle-free fabric ensures you stay put-together whether you’re commuting to the office or traveling for work.&nbsp;</p><p>This cut runs large, but sizing down will help you achieve a more tailored look.

If you have the freedom to play around with your work wardrobe, this is the pant for you. The cropped length is playful, and we’re obsessed with all of the bold colors these pants come in. This fabric is lightweight and ultra-stretchy for all-day comfort, thanks to a blend of linen and cotton. The flattering high-waist prevents gapping in the back on curvier frames, and the silhouette elongates you despite the cropped length.</p><p>These pants do feel more casual and may not work for formal offices, thanks to the fabric blend and details like oversized pockets. They also wrinkle easily due to the linen makeup, which is less-than-ideal when you’re trying to look polished. We also think the sizing options could be better. However, we love this pair in the summer for a bright and breathable style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 23-34<strong> </strong>|<strong> Material: </strong>Viscose, linen, cotton, elastane | <strong>Inseam</strong>: 24 inches | <strong>Colors</strong>: 13</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Inseam</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Frustratingly, there’s no universal standard for petite inseams — when shopping, you’ll typically find anything between 25.5 and 30 inches. Some brands define petite as 5’4” or less, while some brands consider it 5’2” or less, so if you’re even shorter you’ll likely need to look for the shortest inseams possible. The inseam you should select will depend on your own height, as well as your desired length (for example, cropped versus full length).&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When deciding on the silhouette of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work pant</a>, think about what types of pants you feel best in and which are best suited for your workplace. “Universally speaking, I would recommend a straight leg cut, preferably if it hits at the ankle,” says McKenna. A straight leg, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Quince Ultra-Stretch Ponte Straight Leg Pant</a>, looks amazing on all figures and goes with different types of shoes.

Her one caveat: “If you have a very short torso you may want to opt for a mid-rise pair so it will hit you at your waist.”</p><p>However, there’s a difference between wide leg versus baggy or slouchy. “I stay away from wide leg pants that are too flared or baggy, as I find that those make me look shorter,” says Kay.
