For example,&nbsp;<a href=#>Cassadee Pope</a> and <a href=#>Danielle Bradbery</a> signed to Big Machine Label Group.</li><li>Winners are also eligible to earn royalties on future sales.</li></ul><p>The cash prize has strings attached to it.&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Daily News</a>&nbsp;reports that&nbsp;if a contestant violates the contract they signed with NBC, they will not walk away with the prize. Any contestant who reveals the details of the show's contract can be sued for between $100,000&nbsp;and $1 million.</p><p>Previous The Voice winners have been open about the fact that signing a label deal is not necessarily a springboard to riches and fame; in fact, more Voice winners have experienced lukewarm marketplace results at best than have shot to the top of the charts.</p><p>Sundance Head and Craig Wayne Boyd are two&nbsp;who expressed disappointment with how their label home treated them immediately afterward. Season 13 winner Chloe Kohanski had all but disappeared professionally before turning up to say goodbye to <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>&nbsp;during the Season 23 finale.</p><p>Along with the cash prize, trophy and record deal, for the most part, contestants still have the mentorship and support of their celebrity coaches when the show is over. Season 14 champion Brynn Cartelli opened mentor/coach&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a>'s Meaning of Life Tour along with <a href=#>Kelsea Ballerini</a>.</p><p>Contestants are often seen appearing on The Voice with&nbsp;new music or collaborations after their season is done, so the association can pay off in future exposure for new products. Cartelli also <a href=#>says the show's wardrobe department </a>let her take "anything she wanted" home with her.</p><p>According to&nbsp;New York Daily News, contestants are paid a small stipend to cover expenses during the filming of the show, but they give up some basic legal protections in agreeing to take their shot at fame and fortune.</p><p>The contract stipulates that the show can change the rules at any time, eliminate contestants even if they are winning via public votes and completely ignore the show's voting system altogether, including the sales for the contestants' iTunes songs.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Blake Shelton's Winners From 'The Voice': Where Are They Now?</h2>How many of the nine Team Blake winners from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Voice</a> can you name? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Shelton</a> is the show's winningest coach, and several have had hits at country radio and beyond. Several more have shifted genres, changed their name or just flat-out gone missing. Here is the latest on every Team Blake winner from The Voice.<p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: Billy Dukes</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Famous Singers from The Voice, Then + Now</h2>Ten&nbsp;years (and counting) made a huge difference for many of the most popular singers and stars of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Voice</a>.&nbsp;<a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>&nbsp;looks noticeably different, but so do some of country music's most memorable performers.Winners like&nbsp;<a href=#>Cassadee Pope</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Danielle Bradbery</a>&nbsp;wore&nbsp;baby faces when they auditioned during their respective seasons. The same can be said for&nbsp;<a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a>, a forgotten castmember from the show who's transformed more than anyone else on this list of&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;stars then and now.<p class=photogallery-credit>Gallery Credit: <a href=#>Billy Dukes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmsKCRqXqlu8SsZK2glWLEqrrNnqlmp5ZiwamxjK%2BmopuVYrSmwI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./whos-richest-member-take-net-worths-ranked-robbie-williams-la-mansions-and-upcoming-biopic-gary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Whos the richest member of Take That?
