It came almost two years after he married former actress <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> and the duo moved across the Atlantic. The couple now live in California and, in the four years since, have been rather outspoken about the Duke’s family. From Harry’s memoir Spare to his and Meghan’s Oprah interview and <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary; they haven’t been shy about how they feel. Yet despite <a href=#>King Charles’</a> cancer diagnosis, it seems the walls between the brothers are still up.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1233751240-2-1024x769.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-said-to-be-still-angry-with-harry>Prince William said to be ‘still angry’ with Harry</h2><p>Sources say <a href=#>Prince William</a> has told friends he is still unhappy with Harry, 39, over the way he has spoken about the royals since stepping down as a senior member of the family.</p><p>The 42-year-old apparently does not want his brother back as a working <a href=#>royal</a> and will take on more duties if needed rather than sharing them with his brother.</p><p>He is understood to believe Harry and Meghan, 42, “cannot be trusted.”</p><p>A friend of William’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> The Daily Beast, after the news about their dad, Harry is “out” for good and the idea of the Prince of Wales trusting his brother is a “fantasy.”</p><p>They explained: “The news about their father is absolutely shocking, but I don’t think it means William wants to meet up with Harry and shake hands for the cameras.</p><p>“If the papers want to write that they are going to be having pints together and a heart-to-heart, they will, but in reality, the idea that William and Kate are ever, ever going to let Harry back into their lives, or trust him with any personal information ever again is a total fantasy.</p><p>“It’s simply not possible to exaggerate how bad and how damaged the relationship is, and how angry William is at Harry for betraying him for money.”</p><p>“This isn’t just two guys falling out. The point is, Harry betrayed the monarchy. He can’t be trusted, he is out.”</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit has contacted Prince William’s representatives for comment.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-william-will-be-holding-up-the-monarchy>William ‘will be holding up the monarchy’</h2><p>Some royal commentators have <a href=#>speculated</a> the royal family might be “thinking in a strange way” in order to get Prince Harry doing royal duties, despite the fact he’s stepped down.</p><p>Charlotte Griffiths, an editor at Mail on Sunday, previously said: “William is going to be flat out. But again, he’s supposed to be looking after his wife. It really goes to show how thinly spread the monarchy is at the moment. But it will be down to William.</p><p>“<a href=#>Harry’s flying over</a>, but he’s, of course, not allowed to do any public duties. But they might be thinking in a strange way, ‘If only we could sort of get Harry muck in, but that ship has obviously sailed many years ago.”</p><p>She added things for The Firm would be “a lot simpler” if they were “a normal family.”</p><p>“If life was simpler, or perhaps if it were a normal family to say, ‘Look, while you’re over from LA would you mind just mucking in, cutting a few ribbons, getting involved?’ But we all know that’s not how the monarchy works.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2d9cLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZqyVobm0ecWroJ6mlKh6qbHSZpinn6KuerDCxKtkoZmip8a0ecGen5qumaS%2Fbr%2FOrqmcnV2orrq%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./scotsman-co-white-oak-lazy-susan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Scotsman Co.
