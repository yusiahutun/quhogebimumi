Without knowing what it means, you get frustrated. You start coming up with different explanations or wondering what you are doing wrong.</p><h2>What does it mean when a man avoids eye contact with a woman?</h2><p class=align-left>There are many reasons a man would avoid eye contact with you. This can range from attraction to guilt, social anxiety, or lack of interest. Below is a look at some of these reasons:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/367c0643b8de30c6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 questions a girl asks when she likes you and wants to date</span></p></a><h3>1. He is sad or angry about something</h3><p class=align-left>Emotional expressions change around the eyes, communicating what you feel to others. You avoid <a href=#>eye contact </a>when you don't want someone to see what you're feeling (especially a negative emotion).</p><p class=align-left>When a guy avoids eye contact, he could be hiding negative emotions so as not to worry you or for fear of appearing vulnerable. He could be sad or angry about something that has happened, or it could be that he is angry with you and doesn't want to confront you.</p><h3>2. He is attracted to you</h3><p class=align-left>Does a guy avoid eye contact if he likes you? The answer is yes. There are several reasons why a guy might avoid eye contact if he is into you. First, he might be nervous to show that he likes you, especially if he is uncertain if you feel the same. In such a case, you can find that he breaks eye contact when you look at him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c092ca14da586aca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does he need space or is he done? 7 simple ways to tell</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Does avoiding eye contact mean attraction? It's also possible that a guy is attracted to you but is trying to play it cool, hence the lack of eye contact. Lastly, he could avoid eye contact deliberately to pique your interest and curiosity.</p><h3>3. He is shy or introverted</h3><p class=align-left>Shyness is another top reason a man might avoid eye contact with you. Many shy people, especially introverts or those suffering from social anxiety, tend to avoid making eye contact. This can be due to feeling uncomfortable with new people or a <a href=#>new environment</a> or as a means to avoid awkward moments when talking to others.</p><p class=align-left>Another thing to note is that shy people might avoid eye contact whether they like you or not. So, the best thing to do with such a person is to start slowly and get to know them. Once they are comfortable with you, they might have an easier time making and maintaining eye contact.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/18bd227cfb203089.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why is she avoiding eye contact all of a sudden? 7 possible reasons</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/367c0643b8de30c6.jpg><h3>4. He feels intimidated by you</h3><p class=align-left>Insecurity could be another explanation when a man avoids eye contact with a woman. In such a case, he might not be shy or suffer from social anxiety, but he could feel intimidated by you for one reason. For example, he might have low self-esteem, making him think you are out of his league.</p><p class=align-left>The guy might also like you but could be worried that he will make a fool of himself by interacting with you. He could also be intimidated by your confidence and personality. The best you can do in such a situation is start a conversation with him and try to put him at ease.</p><h3>5. He doesnâ€™t want to interact with you</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes, there is no hidden meaning when a guy avoids eye contact with you; it could simply be a sign that he is not interested in interacting with you. He could find your conversation boring and thus avoid eye contact as a way to end it. Or he could be uncomfortable with the environment you are in and want to leave.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9b1b8a636b616304.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Signs of unspoken attraction between coworkers to notice</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It's not always easy to know if a guy is disinterested in you simply because he avoids eye contact. So, it would help if you also looked for other signs, such as a nervous smile (or lack of one), uncomfortable body posture, or his eyes constantly scanning the room for someone else.</p><h3>6. He is not attracted to you</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes, avoiding eye contact indicates that someone is not attracted to you. It's also possible that the guy is avoiding eye contact not to mislead you or is scared to tell you that he is not attracted to you. Either way, you cannot do anything about this situation.</p><h3>7. He is involved with someone else</h3><p class=align-left>When a man avoids eye contact with a woman, it might mean he's involved with someone else. Therefore, when a man doesnâ€™t look you in the eyes, it could be that he is involved with someone else and avoids eye contact to let you know this. It could also be possible that he is not in a relationship but is interested in someone else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/18d1d2ec68c66732.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>13 signs he thinks you're not good enough for him to date you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Again, it's not always easy to tell this from lack of eye contact alone. Therefore, you should look for other signs, such as a <a href=#>ring on his finger</a> or another girl he is hanging close to or being affectionate with.</p><h3>8. He is hiding something from you</h3><p class=align-left>Lack of eye contact is a sign of deception. If a man is avoiding eye contact all of a sudden, he is likely hiding something from you. A man who is feeling guilty could avoid eye contact so as not to feel judged, accused, exposed, or vulnerable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c092ca14da586aca.jpg><p class=align-left>He could also be doing it so as not to get caught in a lie, thus leading to confrontation. It would help to look for other signs of deception besides eye contact. This includes fidgeting, a tense posture, saying too little or too much, and being defensive.</p><h3>9. He might not be able to make eye contact</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/afce4b1d7a65c4d3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ funny questions to ask a guy to make him laugh out loud</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Is a guy avoiding eye contact with you? It could be that he cannot maintain visual contact due to a medical condition (or other reasons). For instance, people on the autism spectrum might feel anxious or overwhelmed by eye contact; hence they tend to avoid it.</p><p class=align-left>Likewise, people with ADHD might have trouble focusing on something (including another person's eye). Therefore, they are unlikely to maintain good eye contact during a conversation or across from you in the room.</p><h3>10. He has no idea you are trying to make eye contact with him</h3><p class=align-left>Lastly, a guy could avoid eye contact because he doesn't realize you are trying to get his attention. He might be too busy with what he is doing (like talking to someone else) that he hasn't noticed you yet.</p><p class=align-left>It is also possible for a man to be tuned out due to the thoughts running around in his mind. He could be dealing with financial problems or simply wondering what he will eat later. In this case, the best thing you can do is make the first move and <a href=#>start a conversation</a> if you're interested in him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bfb52626ba1beb41.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to make your angry girlfriend happy over text in 10 ways</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Men tend to maintain eye contact to appear confident and strengthen their <a href=#>relationships</a>. So what does it mean when a man avoids eye contact with a woman? The above reasons will help you understand what leads to this behaviour. Also, observe his behavioural cues to avoid making the wrong conclusions.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared a guide on <a href=#>how to write a letter </a>to your friend inviting him to attend your birthday party.
