Chicago rapper Lil Durk agreed that Lil Baby’s asking price was too low and told him he should up it to $200,000 as well. “F*** that,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> at Lil Baby in response. “200k.”</p><p id=par-4_21>In May 2020, rapper Vince Staples confirmed that Lil Baby charged $100,000 for a feature on his song “East Point Prayer.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Lil Baby now charges $350,000 for a feature</h2><p id=par-5_41>In an October 2022 appearance on Big Loon’s The Experience podcast, Lil Baby discussed his going rate for features these days. In the two years since he first said his asking price was $100,000, he’s more than tripled his rate.</p><p id=par-6_65>“<a href=#>I don’t even be doing features no more</a>,” he said honestly when asked how much he charges for a feature. “Like, $300,000, $350,000. But I ain’t been doing features lately.” He explained that he took a step back from appearing as a guest on other artists’ songs because he was busy working on his third studio album It’s Only Time, released in October 2022.</p><p id=par-7_37>Still, he hasn’t stopped doing features altogether, and is open to them when he’s not as busy. “If I know&nbsp;I ain’t putting out no album, or I ain’t got nothing going on, like, why not?” he said.</p><p id=par-8_25>In early 2022, he teamed up with superstar rapper <a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> for not one but two collaborations: “Do We Have a Problem?” and “Bussin'”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-lil-baby-is-much-happier-today>Lil Baby is much happier today</h2><p id=par-9_25>Lil Baby went on to speak about his life today and how it compares to being behind bars before his rap career took off.</p><p id=par-10_77>“There was a long time I wasn’t happy … But now I’m finally in like a happy stage. I wake up, I’ll be happy now,” he said. “I don’t know. A lot of s*** I be going through, getting adjusted to this, changing, having to stop being around people I’m used to being around. … It was just like adapting to my new environment — s*** had me in a little dark spot for a minute, man.”</p><p id=par-11_39>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;It’s Only Me‘s release, Lil Baby reflected on his Atlanta upbringing and how it has affected his music, as well as Atlanta’s production of hit-making rappers over the past three decades.</p><p id=par-12_34>“Honestly, I think there’s something in the water,” he said honestly. “It’s the upbringing, it’s the culture, it’s the things we see, the people we watched on TV. It’s a repeating cycle of greatness.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5qriMm5ibsV2ivLOxjK2fmqZdqb%2BqvMuem2aoop6wpnnFnpitraKaeq2t0q1ka2Wpmq6zv42hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-riley-leaves-audience-stunned-goes-braless-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Riley leaves audience stunned when she goes braless</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hayley-mills-former-child-star-155094.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hayley Mills Opens up About Being a Former Child Star: I Always Felt a Bit on the Outside (EXC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
