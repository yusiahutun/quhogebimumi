While the rainbow-haired provocateur is dropping a lot of <a href=# rel>new music</a> as of late, the shadow of that attack still looms over his current pop culture presence. Moreover, it's a news story that people keep talking about and commenting on, whether within or outside of the industry. As such, the Chicago MC explained that there's a difference between each case, which is made more ironic by the fact that the New York rapper made fun of Reese for getting jumped back in the day.</p><p>"S**t, I was like 'Damn,' 'cause he was making fun of me when I got jumped," Lil Reese remarked of <a href=# rel>6ix9ine's beatdown</a>. "But I ain't get jumped like how he got jumped. I got jumped on some... N***as was scared to fight me one-on-one. Grabbin' me, trying to stop me from going to the car to go get my move. He got whooped. Like, his a** got beat bad, so he got jumped jumped. I ain't get jumped. N***as was stopping me, holding on me, grabbing on me from going to go grab something for their a**."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-reese-speaks-on-6ix9ine-attack>Lil Reese Speaks On 6ix9ine Attack</h2></span><p>Of course, the <a href=# rel>beef</a> between these two persists, even though Lil Reese held back on more disrespectful views on 6ix9ine's assault. "I love going to, you know, restaurants and not have to say, ‘Oh, I’ll wait for the security team,'” the "WAPAE" artist stated. “I’ll just go do it. For me, it was tough to watch [video of the attack] because it was so unexpected… <a href=# rel>It’s cowardly</a>. I think it was cowardly, I think it was opportunistic. But again, I’m not mad because I know that, in the streets, there’s no rules. I’m lost for words because you can’t blame them. They saw an opportunity and they took it.</p><p>"I think life just keeps going,” he added. “I can capitalize off of anything. I’m that talented,&nbsp;I don’t need to get beat up <a href=# rel>to sell a record</a>." However you may feel about the different situations, it's clear that both artists won't let it define them.
