Why, you ask? It was the year <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> and <a href=#>Katie Holmes</a> married and became one the most prominent couples in Hollywood. But, the duo sadly divorced in 2012, leaving many fans wondering: why did Katie leave Tom?</p><p>Back in June 2012, Tom got a call from Katie while he was on set telling him that their five-year-long marriage was over. “He was about to do a stunt, and he got off his motorcycle to take the call,” a source said, according to <a href=#>People</a>. “He’s been in shock since that day.”</p><p>The breakup came as a shock to fans since Tom was known for dancing around on Oprah Winfrey’s couch as he confessed his love for Katie. According to many reports, Katie split from Tom to protect their now-11-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise, from Tom’s religion, <a href=#>Scientology</a>.</p><p>When the couple first wed, <a href=#>Katie had ties to the church</a> and their ceremony even practiced some of the rituals. But, once their daughter Suri started to grow up, Katie began to worry and started having doubts about the religion. Allegedly, she was worried that Suri would no longer talk to her just like Tom and his ex-wife Nicole Kidman’s adopted kids did to them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-suri.jpg><p>Tom, Katie, and Suri when they were a happy family.</p><p>Things really took a turn for the worse when someone from the church’s staff moved in to make sure they were upholding the values of Scientology in their daily lives. Shortly after realizing the pair had “big differences” in their opinions of life, Katie filed for divorce. However, she was reportedly told to not blame Scientology as the reason for their split. Sources say she was allegedly so worried about protecting Suri at that time that she would have agreed to anything.</p><p>Today, Katie lives with their little girl in NYC — and is happily dating actor Jamie Foxx. “I really enjoy my life,” she told <a href=#>Ocean Drive</a> in a previous interview. “I don’t really regret anything that I’ve done. I’ve learned from everything, and everything sort of leads you to the next place. I just keep going.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn7JllJ6xbrfAraCeZZikua6x0majnpmmmnq1u8xmmqutmaiybn2TaW9tcV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./50-cent-and-elise-neal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>50 Cent and Elise Neal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ifa-2023-sennheiser-launches-ambeo-mini-soundbar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sennheiser Launches Big Sounding Ambeo Mini Soundbar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
