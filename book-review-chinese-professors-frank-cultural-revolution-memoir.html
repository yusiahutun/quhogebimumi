Ji Xianlin writes that he had waited years for someone to step up and explain for younger generations the chaos of the 1960s. Under Mao Zedong, youth turned on their elders and historical objects were smashed in a political frenzy that, to many, still makes no sense at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/486w/public/images/methode/2016/02/05/92b98654-caf4-11e5-9c95-074a8ff7bdd1_486x.jpg>What worried Ji was that so many of the perpetrators silently moved on with their lives as China opened to the world and transformed.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They are the cancer cells of our socialist society, and letting them off the hook for their crimes was a mistake,” Ji writes in the preface. “Chinese society today appears peaceful and harmonious, and things seem to be going well. But our society is ethically hollow, local government is often corrupt, and many individuals are incompetent. If we trace these problems to their roots, we are likely to find them in the Cultural Revolution and in the people mentioned above.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Back in the chaos, everyone was blinded by partisanship, Ji writes, himself included. In the swirl of the Peking University campus, the ageing scholar eventually was targeted as well.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">SEE ALSO: Lessons from 1966 – why we should never forget the disastrous consequences of the Cultural Revolution</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His memoir could use more context for readers who’ve never come across the Cultural Revolution, but his details bring the upside-down world into some focus: the mass denunciations while he stood looking at his feet, a wooden board with his “crimes” hung around his neck with steel wire. Being pelted with stones. Being forced to plant sweet potatoes on a collective farm until his fingertips bled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/236w/public/images/methode/2016/02/05/238e938c-caf4-11e5-9c95-074a8ff7bdd1_236x.jpg>“My testicles became so swollen that I couldn’t even stand up or close my legs,” he writes. Allowed by his guards to report to a military clinic, he crawled two hours to reach it. But when he announced his political status, the doctor ordered him away.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The swelling eventually eased. So did the chaos. Ji slowly was allowed a return towards normal life. The respected scholar of Sanskrit was given a job as a campus security guard. Thinking the post would be his lifelong fate, he quietly began a translation of the longest and most difficult text he could find, the Indian epic Ramayana. With his tainted political status, no one would ever publish it, he decided.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even then, he didn’t dare bring the text to work with him, where people might notice. Instead, he slipped translated bits of the text into his pocket every day and spent his hours thinking them into rhyming verse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As I stared into space, no one could have known what I was thinking,” Ji writes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is the kind of self-protection that some in China continue to exercise even today.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Associated Press</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2Bwu8qsZpqqpJ6wrbGOanBpcWdrfXCuzqiiZqqVq7amw4ycn6KmlaiybrzRqJ2eq6Okv7R5xauYp6NdmMKtwNSrmKVloprDsLjUraCopl2isq67yKs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dead-company-not-dead-announces-las-vegas-sphere-residency.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dead &amp;amp; Company Not Dead Announces Las Vegas Sphere Residency</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-moto-boots.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>7 Best Moto Boots, Starting at $41</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
