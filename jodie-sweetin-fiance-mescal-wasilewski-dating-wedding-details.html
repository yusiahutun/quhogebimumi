The happy couple got married six months later in a romantic California ceremony. </span><b>Keep scrolling to meet her spouse.&nbsp;</b></p><h2><b>Who Is Jodie Sweetin’s Husband, Mescal Wasilewski?</b></h2><p><span>Mescal is a therapist for Catalyst Recovery, a program that provides at-home addiction treatment and recovery services, according to his LinkedIn profile. He obtained his bachelor’s degree at California State University before pursuing a master of social work at Hunter College in New York City.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’ve worked in the field of addiction and mental health for over 16 years, helping to treat clients with a range of diagnoses and difficulties,” he wrote on his profile. “Much of my work has been with those suffering from addiction and various mental health issues, as well as extensive work with adolescent clients.

The</span><a href=#> <i><span>Dancing With the Stars</span></i></a><span> alum shared a touching Valentine’s Day tribute to her beau featuring a photo of them kissing.</span></p><p><span>“Find someone who you can share this kind of love with … Someone who doesn’t just show you they love you one day a year,” she captioned the post. “Who isn’t afraid to look silly when they tell you they love you. Who doesn’t judge you for past mistakes, but who wants to build a better future together.”</span></p><p><span>Since then, Jodie has continued to share photos with Mescal on date nights, attending baseball games together and concerts. In February 2022, the happy couple attended the wedding of their friends in Costa Rica. After posting some photos from the beachside ceremony, Jodie clarified in her Instagram caption that she and her now-husband hadn’t tied the knot at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>​​”No … Mescal and I didn’t get married! Not yet!” she wrote. “But we DID get to go out for an adventure day before we left, and yes, that’s me white water tubing and hanging upside down on a zip line through a canyon.”</span></p><p><span>Months later in July 2022, they walked down the aisle. As for their intimate celebration, Jodie told </span><a href=#><i><span>Closer</span></i></a><span> the pair “kept it very small.” She was ecstatic that her two children were part of the big day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“My girls were so excited,” she continued. “I’m really happy and in love.”</span></p><h2><b>How Many Times Has Jodie Been Married?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>Jodie was married and divorced three times before finding love with Mescal. She tied the knot with Los Angeles police officer </span><b>Shaun Holguin</b><span> in 2002. The pair divorced in 2006. One year later, the</span><i><span> Beyond the Edge</span></i><span> contestant walked down the aisle with </span><b>Cody Herpin</b><span>. Together they welcomed their daughter, Zoie, in 2008. Their divorce was finalized in 2010.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The California native married </span><b>Morty Coyle </b><span>in 2012. The former couple share a daughter, Beatrix, who arrived in 2010. Jodie filed for legal separation in 2013, and their divorce was finalized three years later.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jpp2hlWLAuLHEraCnZZaerq%2BvxGaknquTlrluw8CsoKWdp6i4qnnDmquippdixKaww6KloGWUmsGitcusZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-hudson-jokes-about-diet-for-glass-onion-bikini-scene.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Hudson Jokes About Diet for 'Glass Onion' Bikini Scene</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-ratajkowskis-bridal-dress-at-the-oscars-party-risks-wardrobe-malfunction.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Ratajkowski's Bridal dress at the Oscars party risks wardrobe malfunction</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
