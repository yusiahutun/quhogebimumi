Your thumb should remain on the outside while your other fingers are interlaced with your toes.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The position should be held for 30 seconds before you pull the toes down and hold for another five seconds. The motions are to be repeated 10 times.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>FOOT AND ANKLE EXTENSORS STRETCH&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Ms Rodriguez's next move is intended to prevent shin splints and stress fractures.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>After kneeling down on both knees, you should put a tightly rolled hand town under your feet where your toes and the top of your foot meet. Once your towel is in position, you need to carefully sit back onto your heels until you feel the stretch across your feet and ankles. You are advised do this move twice and hold the position for 30 seconds each time.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>PERONEALS STRETCH&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Step three tackles your foot and lower leg alignment, as well as dysfunctions in your foot and ankle joints, and requires a strap that will not stretch. A long belt should suffice.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>While laying on your back, place the strap around the ball of your foot and lift that leg up. Your other leg should remain extended on the floor. Toes should be stretched towards you before you turn your foot inwards. The strap should be held with the hand opposite the foot that you are stretching. You should hold the move for 30 seconds and repeat it twice for each leg.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-b3c5bbfe2a997e35 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/14/269D16E600000578-2993999-Top_tip_Stretches_can_help_counteract_the_negative_effects_of_il-a-2_1426292032715.jpg height=538 width=624 alt="Top tip: Stretches can help counteract the negative effects of ill-fitting shoes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Top tip: Stretches can help counteract the negative effects of ill-fitting shoes</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>CALF STRETCH&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The following move is just a simple calf stretch meant to strengthen your&nbsp;Achilles heels and protect your calf tears. While standing with your front leg bent and your back leg extended, push your hands against the wall and keep your back knee straight with your heels glued to the ground. After 30 seconds, you should move your extended foot closer to the wall while bending your knee slightly, but keeping both heels on the floor. This position should also be held for 30 seconds. Both moves should then be repeated on your other side.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span><span class=mol-style-bold>FHL STRETCH</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:14px>Ms Rodriquez's final stretch is supposed to avoid&nbsp;tendinitis&nbsp;and problems with your big toes. This is also an easy move, which only requires you to be close to a door frame or ledge of a wall. Put your big toe against the door or wall and slide it down so it points to the ceiling while you push the ball of your foot towards the ground. You should bend your knee while keeping your other toes and heel flat on the ground.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p><img id=i-f6a38f3c9c34714d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/13/2523FAA300000578-2993999-image-a-50_1426283534609.jpg height=1019 width=306 alt="Trademark look: Gwyneth wore black platform heels to the&nbsp;Fontainebleau Miami Beach Resort Grand Opening Gala in 2008 (pictured) and spiked rhinestone heels to the the Met Gala in 2012" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-c03c71a1cf46a3c4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/13/269E3DA100000578-2993999-image-m-49_1426283521526.jpg height=1019 width=306 alt="Trademark look: Gwyneth wore black platform heels to the&nbsp;Fontainebleau Miami Beach Resort Grand Opening Gala in 2008 and spiked rhinestone heels to the the Met Gala in 2012 (pictured)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Trademark look: Gwyneth wore black platform heels to the&nbsp;Fontainebleau Miami Beach Resort Grand Opening Gala in 2008 (L) and spiked rhinestone heels to the the Met Gala in 2012 (R)</p><img id=i-9043b97851b47422 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/13/269E3DB100000578-2993999-image-m-70_1426284017214.jpg height=1160 width=634 alt="Healthy lifestyle: Gwyneth, who is a devotee of fitness guru Tracy Anderson, &nbsp;was photographed running while filming a scene for her 2012 movie Thanks for Sharing&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Healthy lifestyle: Gwyneth, who is a devotee of fitness guru Tracy Anderson, &nbsp;was photographed running while filming a scene for her 2012 movie Thanks for Sharing&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Katie Holmes, Oprah and Naomi Campbell are among those who have developed dreaded hammer toes and bunions over time.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Ms Rodriguez's first exercise is meant to combat those particular physical woes, as well as the painful pinched nerves and stress fractures that can occur in the foot.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Meanwhile, her foot and ankle extensors stretch is designed to prevent shin splints and stress fractures.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Anyone who follows popular celebrity fitness guru Tracey Anderson, whose client list includes the likes of Gwyneth, Jennifer Lopez and Lena Dunham, will be thrilled to know that this stretch is perfect after a strenuous dance cardio session, or any workout that puts stress on the shins.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>For issues with foot and lower leg alignment, as well as dysfunctions in your foot and ankle, Ms Rodriguez recommends a peroneals stretch.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>And the moves are not at all exotic or difficult.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=i-1de59772a60edfa9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/03/13/269E3DCF00000578-2993999-image-m-99_1426284572341.jpg height=812 width=634 alt="Dramatic entrance: This scene from Black Swan shows Natalie Portnman playiing a ballerina.
