Upon arrival, the first deputy spotted a man later identified as Blake Tokman fleeing naked into the backyard of the second home he stands accused of breaking into. As the officer chased him down, Tokman hopped into a pool ... before getting out and running toward a nearby trampoline, jumping onto it and playing dead.</p><p>In a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, Volusia Sheriff's Office says Tokman "resisted the deputy's attempts to secure him in handcuffs," as video appears to show him asking for the deputy's name repeatedly instead of putting his hands behind his back.</p><p>"He's slippery," one deputy noted, as another said the man was covered in a "paste." Someone was also heard saying, "Well, we definitely know he doesn't have anything on him," before noting that it "smells like toothpaste" Authorities later confirmed Tokman was covered in wheel bearing grease, peppermint oil and blood.</p><p>As the owner of the home came out to possibly identify the alleged intruder, Tokman appeared to exclaim, "I'm a lifeguard, that's what I am." While the owner had no idea who he was, it seems some of the deputies on the scene recognized the suspect, however, and started to refer to him as Blake. A quick search of Volusia County Jail records show 11 arrests from 2017 through January 20 for a "Blake Tokman" with the same date of birth as the suspect; he was most recently released on March 14.</p><p>"I think that's him, I don't know, he has all this weird s--- on him," said one deputy, as they all expressed mild disgust over whatever was on Tokman rubbing off on them as well.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:472a713f-c56a-4bfc-b29d-2dc64d643e7c data-container-ref=toofab:article:98071754-600c-4d4c-bc68-5b7b19991543 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4d/5by4/2023/04/07/4da303781c4948a0b39d722740fbccee_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Law&Crime</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Watch Moment Man Calmly Approaches Police & Admits to Shooting, Killing Woman</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>According to the Sheriff's Office, Tokman allegedly "smashed out the windows of one house to make entry, then left and broke into another home." They added "both homes were occupied at the time of the break-ins."</p><p>"Tokman appeared to be under the influence of unknown substances," the statement continued, saying it took "four deputies to get him into custody, plus three more medical professionals to secure him on a stretcher for evaluation and treatment of injuries he caused himself."</p><p>He's accused of also kicking or striking three of the deputies, one of whom they said sustained a laceration to his arm.</p><p>Tokman was charged with 2 counts of occupied burglary, 3 counts of battery on a law enforcement officer, 2 counts of criminal mischief, and resisting arrest with violence. He was reportedly transported for further medical evaluation and treatment before he's taken to the Volusia County Branch Jail. As of Friday afternoon, there was no new booking sheet for the suspect.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4497bd5b-3578-44f3-a39d-d79e28226141 data-container-ref=toofab:article:98071754-600c-4d4c-bc68-5b7b19991543 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2023/03/30/64be51c5609f4016bf396437143fd0b4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Montgomery County Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Video Shows Moment Stick Shift Foiled Teen Carjacking Attempt</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21maXBfo66sscNmnqudkaiypXnUqWSfpJ%2BntqWtjKaYp2WjqsCxscKtZJukkaCybsDOpKSapl2Wv7Ox0q2cnWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fashion-month-orange-sweater.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>3 Ways to Wear Fashion Months Favorite Orange Sweater</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rod-stewart-returns-to-rock-with-56-city-arena-tour.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rod Stewart Returns To Rock With 56-City Arena Tour</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
