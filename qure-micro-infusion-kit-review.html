But! Anyone who has dabbled in the beauty industry knows: treatments get really expensive, really quickly. That’s why it’s so important to keep up with your daily skincare needs (like <a href=#>cleansing</a>, <a href=#>exfoliating</a>, and treating) at home so you can stave off expensive, in-office treatments for longer.</p><p>But with daily innovations comes new ways to experience treatments at home, and one treatment our parenting editor, Rita Templeton, recently tested out is the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Qure Micro-Infusion</a> at-home kit that delivers micro-infusion skincare without ever stepping outside — and it’s a fraction of the price.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-to-know-about-qure-skincare>What to Know About Qure Skincare</h2><p>Qure skincare is perhaps best known for its customizable, FDA-cleared LED mask, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q-Rejuvalight Led Mask</a>. This mask quickly went<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#> viral on TikTok,</a> which led customers to more of their products, like this micro-infusion kit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-14-at-1.14.19-PM.png><p>Qure, Micro-Infusion System</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-is-qure-micro-infusion-system>What Is Qure Micro-Infusion System?</h2><p>The Qure Micro-Infusion system uses 24K gold 0.5mm needles to “stamp” the skin, creating small cuts into the skin’s surface, which is said to allow the deeper penetration of skincare products. The brand says the needles that are used are thinner than a strand of human hair, so you will virtually feel nothing as you stamp it across your skin (although, our testing editor didn’t fully agree with this — more on that below).</p><p>According to Deeptej Singh, MD, a board certified dermatologist and founder of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sandia Dermatology,</a> “both home and in-office micro-infusion systems can create controlled, standardized injury, and the hope is that both are done in a sterile environment to reduce the risk of infection.” For this reason, it’s very important to follow the instructions if you’re using an at-home device, and to make sure that you never use the same system twice if you personally choose to try an at-home system. The Qure Micro-Infusion system comes with multiple disposable needles, so you won’t be re-sticking yourself twice.</p><p>“Small micro trauma alone, so long as it is not in conjunction with inflammation, can stimulate a non-specific collagen response that is good for the skin,” says Dr. Singh. You should always check with your derm before beginning a treatment like this, though (especially if you’ve never tried a micro-needling treatment before). Most derms will say that going in-office is a safer route if you’re afraid of damaging your skin or spreading infection at home. Therefore, it’s up to each individual if they want to try out a micro-infusion system in the comfort of their own space.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=our-honest-review-of-the-qure-micro-infusion-system-according-to-our-parenting-editor-rita-templeton>Our Honest Review of the Qure Micro-Infusion System, According to Our Parenting Editor, Rita Templeton</h2><p>“When it comes to beauty products and treatments, I will try anything once — and I’ve tried a lot of things. However, I’ve never tried micro-infusion, so I was stoked at the opportunity to try Qure out. I made sure to take a ‘before’ picture so I could compare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/before.jpg><p>I was impressed by how professional the Qure kit looked, and felt a little bit like a scientist as I poured the contents of the serum vial into the bottle. (It came with two different serums: Rejuvenating and Hydra-Soothing; I used the Rejuvenating on my first treatment and the Hydra-Soothing on my second.) It also came with multiple disposable needle heads, which I appreciated from a hygienic standpoint, being able to use a fresh one with every treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Not gonna lie, I was a little nervous; even though the needles are teeny-tiny — thinner than a human hair! — I was still puncturing my face, which didn’t exactly sound like a picnic. I had zero idea of what to expect. But when I started the treatment, I realized it wasn’t so bad. Was it completely painless? Nope. But if you ever wax or pluck your eyebrows, for example, it’s about that level of pain. Definitely tolerable.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’ve made a couple of passes over your skin, you pat in any remaining serum. I felt like I had a lot left over, and I’m not sure how much is normal, but I probably only used about half of it during the treatment itself. Still, I used the rest on my skin; it’s very silky-feeling and has a light, pleasant scent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/directly-after.jpg><p>After the treatment my skin felt a little warm and sore — almost like a sunburn. But you do the treatments right before bed, and by the time I woke up in the morning, there was no redness or pain at all. I did have a few miniscule scabs (we’re talking pinprick-sized) here and there but nothing that would be visible if you weren’t looking for it.</p><p>Two weeks later, as advised, I did the second treatment. This photo was taken two days afterward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/after.jpg><p>After two treatments, I can’t exactly say I’m completely blown away by the results. That being said, though — I’ve only had two treatments. As a longtime regular user of skincare products and gadgets, I know that it takes time, patience, and repeated efforts to see a change. I didn’t see a huge difference in my fine lines or anything (I’m 43, though, so lines are gonna line) but I do feel like my skin got a little bit of a radiance boost. And perhaps the biggest shocker of all was that my husband, who is oblivious to the fact that I was even doing this, told me my skin looked ‘young.’ I’ve been with this man for 26 years and he has literally NEVER said a word about my skin, so I consider that a win.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=experts-in-this-article>Experts in This Article</h2><p><strong>Deeptej Singh MD: </strong>A board certified dermatologist and founder of <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sandia Dermatology</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=pin-it>Pin it!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/qure.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2BeH%2BXcWhyZ6Gqv6Z5zKKaq6ddnrunwdKipqdlm57Bbr7Er6Cer18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./from-tv-icon-to-real-life-here-is-what-happened-to-cindy-brady.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>From TV icon to real life: Here is what happened to Cindy Brady</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./3-iconic-watches-olivier-girouds-collection-french-footballer-expected-play-2024-paris-olympics-and.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>3 iconic watches from Olivier Girouds collection: the French footballer is expected to play at th</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
