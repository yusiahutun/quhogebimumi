Tell us about the journey of the company so far?</h3><p>About the Founders: Mansi Sahu, Sarfaraz Momin, and Mahesh Waghdhare co-founded StudioPOD in 2013. After working in the US for a few years, we decided to quit our comfortable lives in the US and move back to India to start an Urban Design practice that focused on human-scaled design. In the past nine years, we have worked relentlessly to push the boundaries of urban design in the Indian and global context.</p><p>The context that we are in, puts us in various roles varying from consultants, activists to advocacy for core issues.

Some of our projects over the last few years include detailed master plans in Abu Dhabi, sustainable development toolkits for the heritage city of Puri, stream rejuvenation in Naya Raipur, tourism master plans in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, and detailed streetscape design execution called One Green Mile in Lower Parel, Mumbai.</p><p>We are also working with several private developers like Godrej, Mahindra, Reliance, and Piramal for Master Planning, Landscape Urbanism, and Implementation projects in multiple regions across India. On all the projects we have worked on, we have tried to push the conventional design boundaries and employ state-of-the-<a href=#>art design ideas and principles</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Q.3. What do you think triggered the growth of the company?</h3><p>City Planning has been traditionally practiced by Architects and Planners in India in a conventional way. With the growth of urban India, it has been quintessential to look at planning and urban design in an integrated manner of systems-thinking through different lenses. With us highly adaptable and collaborative practice with different disciplines that deal with urban transformations and infrastructure, we have been able to position urban design in the mainstay of several infrastructure and transport led projects.</p><p>This unique proposition has led to several interesting projects in the public sector. Similarly, our positioning for development within the private sector, has gotten interest from several of the leading developers in India. They now see urban design as a specialized role that we need to be hired for, for integrated and holistic master planning exercises revolving around the three pillars of sustainable urban development.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Q.4.

Tell us about your professional journey?</h3><p>Mansi Sahu, Sarfaraz Momin, and Mahesh Waghdhare co-founded StudioPOD in 2013. All three had different journeys and global experiences but decided to quit their comfortable lives in the US and move back to India to start an Urban Design practice that focused on human-scaled design. The main aim of creating an Urban Design &amp;amp; Planning focused firm was to execute and design projects that become incubators of change in the neighborhood, region and also at global scale.</p><p>In 2014 Rahul Dalal, a transport engineer and planner joined us with a similar goal to integrate Urban Design &amp;amp; Transport Planning. In the past nine years, we have worked relentlessly to push the boundaries of urban design &amp;amp; Planning in the Indian context. The context that we are in, puts us in various roles varying from consultants, activists to advocacy for core issues.

Any achievements you would like to share?</h3><p>StudioPOD has won several accolades since its inception.</p><p>2014 Best Upcoming urban planning start-up in India – by Smart Cities Council</p><p>2015 AIA Middle East Urban Design Award for Masdar City Phase 2 Detailed Master Plan in collaboration with CBT</p><p>2016 Represented India and presented at the International Smart Cities Summit at Washington, DC, along with Australia and UAE</p><p>2019 Won 1st prize in the Eyes on the Canal Competition for Restoration of the Buckhingham Canal in Chennai, India</p><p>2019 AIA Middle East Urban Design Award for Masdar City Phase 4 Detailed Master Plan in collaboration with CBT and many more</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Q.9. Your take on where Architecture Design is going ahead in the future?</h3><p>For an Urban Design firm, architecture does&amp;#39; t stops within the compounds of a site. We think the Public Realms within the buildings and spaces can become incubators of urban life in Indian cities. With them rich, historic and social context, Indian cities offer tremendous opportunities for integrating significant public spaces with infrastructure upgradation. For an Urban Design firm is a constant exercise of zooming in and zooming out.</p><p>Large scale vision plans with small interventions with big impacts directly on the life of the users. India offers opportunities for design at every corner, one needs to just identify potentials of projects whether in cities and villages. We have design and planning opportunities everywhere.</p><p>New opportunities could be created to develop a better and impactful public realm that can truly transform our country’s quality of life. Boosting the live ability of cities through this innovative integration will make Indian cities truly smart and help transform spaces into successful places is out plan ahead for all future projects at POD.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMC1wcOipqmnlGLBs63NrJ2oqp2eu6h50qmYnJ2jYravwM5mp6WZk5rA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./510698-what-a-man-avoids-eye-contact-a-woman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What does it mean when a man avoids eye contact with a woman?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./416452-patty-gardell-5-interesting-facts-billy-gardells-wife-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Patty Gardell: 5 interesting facts about Billy Gardell's wife</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
