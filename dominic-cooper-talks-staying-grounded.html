"You need to be able to observe people and try to understand other people’s lives," he said. "Some people make the mistake of removing themselves from that because they can’t cope with their new lives living among it. But that’s the best thing for anyone who is a performer. "You have to be in touch with the world and people’s emotions and what they’re reacting to in order to keep your work real and heartfelt."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cac74301ecb3-dom-2-a.jpg><p id=eG5cCPbRSrmX data-wc=97>Greenwich-born Dominic, who previously lived with his friend and co-star James Corden, also opened up about the path that led him to acting.
