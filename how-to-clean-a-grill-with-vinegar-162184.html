To get your grill fully burger-ready, you’ll need to give it a good scrub — but not with a wire brush. Every year, unsuspecting eaters chomp down on wire bristles that have hitched a ride in chunks of charred meat, earning themselves a one-way ticket to the ER. One such unfortunate woman posted on social media about her near-fatal incident with a wire brush three years ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing a terrifying photo of her grill</a> that was covered in dozens of thin wires.
