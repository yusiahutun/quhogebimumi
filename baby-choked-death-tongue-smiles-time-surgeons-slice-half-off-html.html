class=mol-para-with-font><span>The figure is likely to be higher in reality, with mild cases rarely diagnosed.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Cases have been reported in most developed countries, and in the majority of cases it appears to be an isolated case with no known relatives suffering the disorder.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In some cases there is evidence the condition can be inherited.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Children with BWS are often born prematurely but are larger and heavier than expected, given their early arrival.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Typically a child born with BWS will have an enlarged tongue, which can causes breathing, feeding and speaking difficulties, as well as excessive dribbling. It can also cause respiratory problems and result in a protruding lower jaw.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an&nbsp;omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Children with the condition are also likely to suffer enlarged abdominal organs, overgrowth of one half of the body, liver tumours and an enlarged heart or heart defects.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>BWS is diagnosed genetically in 80&nbsp; per cent of cases, with the remainder being diagnosed after a clinical examination.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Source: </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# style=font-weight:700><span><span style=font-style:italic>Beckwith</span></span><span style=font-weight:700;font-style:italic><span>-Wi</span><span>edemann Sy</span><span>ndrome </span><span>Support </span><span>Group</span></span></a>&nbsp;<span class=mol-style-italic>and <a style=font-weight:700 rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><span class=mol-style-bold>National Institutes of Health</span></a></span></p>&lt;!- -
