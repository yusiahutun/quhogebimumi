They’ve been spending time together as friends and really enjoy each other’s company.”</p><p>de Ramon recently split from The Vampire Diaries star Paul Wesley. The two married in 2019 but split earlier in 2022. In regards to her new relationship with Brad, a source told ET, “Ines is pretty chill and private.

In a 2006 interview with Vogue, Jolie confirmed that she and Pitt had developed feelings for each other while working on the film. “I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened. I think a few months in I realized, ‘God, I can’t wait to get to work,” she said at the time. “It took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think, to realize that it might mean something more than we’d earlier allowed ourselves to believe. And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration.”</p><p>In April 2005, Pitt and Jolie were photographed in Kenya with Jolie’s son, Maddox.

He was so gorgeous and sweet. I mean, he was Brad Pitt! My father was devastated [when we broke up]. I was such a kid, I was 22 when we met. It’s taken me until 40 to get my head out of my ass. You can’t make that decision when you’re 22 years old. I wasn’t ready, and he was too good for me.”</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Juliette Lewis (1990 – 1993)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/juliette-lewis-brad-pitt.jpg><p>Pitt met Lewis on the set of the film Too Young to Die in 1990 when he was 27.

While promoting the film, Lewis told The Los Angeles Time that she and Pitt were in love. “We’re at the point in love, where we just like to see each other every single day and we don’t get bored with each other, so it’s really, really nice,” she said.</p><p>In a 2010 interview with The Huffington Post, Lewis looked back on her relationship with Pitt. “It amazes me that people are still fascinated that we went out for years,” she said at the time. “I was a teenager at the time. It’s a lifetime away. I was in my high school years, and it was a wonderful, loving relationship with a fun, smart guy. Then it was over, and he went on to become incredibly famous.”</p><h2 class=p1><span class=s1>Sinitta (1986 – 1988)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/sinitta.jpg><p>Pitt and Sinitta, a British singer known for the song “So Macho” and appearances on shows like I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here, dated on and off for two years between 1986 and 1988.

He was beautiful with the most amazing body. I saw him for two years,” Sinitta said at the time. “He was fun, he was young and very sweet.
