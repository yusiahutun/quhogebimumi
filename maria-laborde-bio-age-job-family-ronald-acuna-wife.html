Just hours after getting married, he hit a grand slam and ended the game beating NL MVP rival Mookie Betts and the Los Angeles Dodgers. This coincidence naturally has fans talking about his marriage and beautiful bride Maria Laborde. So, we shall tell you all in the rest of the writing.</p><h3><strong>Meet Maria Laborde, Ronald Acuña Wife</strong></h3><p>Ronald Acuña wedded his fiancée Maria Laborde in a small ceremony at a house in the mountains about 45 minutes from his team’s hotel. Before that, Ronald had popped the question on 14 January 2023 over a family meal.</p><p>Ronald said they initially planned the wedding to happen in Venezuela in the coming winter. But the terms of Maria’s Venezuelan visa made them do it much earlier.</p><p>Ronald, who also shares two young boys with Maria, shared that because of the visa issue, Maria and the children would have been forced to leave the country at the end of the week and would not have been able to return for three months. That is the only reason they decided to exchange vows on the gameday.</p><p>From what Ronald told ESPN, both their sons were born in Venezuela and together as a family they were really having a hassle with Maria’s coming and going.</p><p>About Maria and his relationship, Ronald said they have always wanted to be together since knowing each other. Also to him, he said Maria and the kids come before anything else.</p><p>As for the honeymoon, Ronald gushed he hopes to postpone the honeymoon until November, “preferably after the World Series.”</p><p>Before the recent occurrence, Maria, former Miss Teen Carabobo 2015, and Ronald had been dating for more than three years. Then, in September 2020, they gave birth to Ronald Daniel Acua Laborde, and his sibling, Jamall, followed in late 2022.</p><h3><strong>Maria Laborde Age</strong></h3><p>Lately, in 2023, Maria Laborde turned 23 years old.</p><h3><strong>Maria Laborde Job</strong></h3><p>Maria Laborde on her social media describes herself as a “public figure”. Also, it turns out, she actually won the “Miss Teen Carabobo” competition in 2015.</p><p>Clearly, it also looks like Maria has been actively pursuing a career as a model for a while now.</p><p>The last time Maria appeared in public it was after getting married to Ronald. Freshly married, and with her young boys she was there watching the Braves beat the Dodgers by 8-7.</p><h3><strong>Is Maria Laborde On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes. Maria was on Instagram as of 2 September 2023. Her account <a href=#>@marialaborde</a>&nbsp;included 11 posts and 109K followers. She also showed glimpses of her life on ‘Maria Laborde’ <a href=#>Facebook</a>&nbsp;every now and then.</p><h3><strong>Maria Laborde Height</strong></h3><p>Good-looking Maria stands above 5’8” in height and seems to love this about herself among other things.</p><h3><strong>Maria Laborde Family</strong></h3><p>Maria’s mother is Astrid Gonzalez de Laborde. She can be found on Instagram <a href=#>@astridgonzalezla</a> showing glimpses from not just her life but also of Maria and the family. While on her <a href=#>Facebook</a>, it is cited that she studied Commercial Administration at Universidad de Carabobo in the Class of 1994. Also, from here one can tell she and Michel Martin Laborde, Maria’s dad, are still together and married. As of 2023, they were most probably living in Chichiriviche, Falcon, Venezuela.</p><p>Just on 4 August 2023, Astrid took to her Facebook to discuss how 23 years ago they got married in the chapel of Cayo Sal, in the Morrocoy National Park, in Chichiriviche. “I thank God for my children, for my grandchildren, for life, for love, and for happiness and prosperity”, she also wrote this next to several long-ago-taken snaps of them.</p><p>In her family, Maria also has a sister and a brother. Her sister is Nerea Laborde, a Venezuelan social media star known for her fashion and bikini modeling, lifestyle, and travel blogging content. She enjoyed 22.8K followers on her IG @ainhoalaborde and some on her TikTok @ainhoaalaborde.</p><p>Then, there is Emilio Laborde (Gonzalez), Maria’s brother (<a href=#>@emiliolabordevzla</a>). He is “a man of integrity, a good son, a husband, and an excellent human being” according to his mother. Also, he turned 27 years old on 11 March 2023.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Maria Laborde’s Nationality?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Both Maria Laborde and her beau are Venezuelan natives.
