The album features Boone and Crystal Gayle in a new recording of her No. 1 hit duet from 1982, "You and I," and the new video is dedicated to the singer's late wife, Shirley.</p><p>Gayle teamed with Eddie Rabbitt for the original hit recording, and Boone says it was his team's idea to invite her for the new rendition of the multi-genre hit.</p><p>"I had never met her," he tells Taste of Country. "I knew Loretta Lynn, but I hadn't me Crystal Gayle before. She's beautiful, and she still sings great."</p><p>The instrumental track had already been recorded, and "it was in a key that was a little high for me," Boone says with a chuckle. "You can tell when you hear me singing that I'm singing it in a very intimate, up-close-in-her-ear kind of way."</p><p>Boone was gratified when Gayle agreed to join him on this project, which he has dedicated to his wife.</p><p>"She went to Heaven," Boone says, but "I haven't lost her. I know where Shirley is, and we're gonna be together. So don't cry for either of us."</p><p>Boone says the reaction to the song has already been overwhelmingly positive.</p><p>"I have yet to mention this to anybody&nbsp;— old, young, country fans or not&nbsp;— when I say, 'I've just re-recorded this song called 'You and I,'' they say, 'Oh, I love that song.'"</p><p>The track appears on Boone's forthcoming Country Jubilee album, which features the 89-year-old pop, rock, gospel and country singer returning to his country roots across the span of 25 tracks. The track listing finds Boone revisiting old classics including "Kaw-Liga," "Tennessee Waltz," "I Feel Like Cryin'," "Old Shep" and more.</p><p>The album also features a fun new track titled "Grits," which Boone tailored especially for line dancing. He recorded it in a star-studded collaboration with Ray Stevens, the Gatlin Brothers, Lorrie Morgan, Deborah Allen and Dean Miller, and he filmed a fun, colorful down-home video for the song:</p><p>Boone says the opening lines of "Grits" came to him in a dream, and it helped touch off the idea for the entire project, which he views not only as a return to his Tennessee roots, but also as a statement of purpose.</p><p>"What I'm trying to do is reinforce the lifestyle of country people. The core of what made our country the greatest in the world, beginning in the country,"&nbsp;he says emphatically. "It was farmers that took up arms to fight the British. They formed the militia. Paul Revere was a country guy. All of the framers of our Constitution were country guys; Jefferson, Washington, Monroe and Adams.</p><p>"I want to re-establish in the corporate mind of America the principles that were country principles to begin with," Boone adds.</p><p>Country Jubilee is set for release on Sept. 8, and the collection is currently available for <a href=#>pre-order</a> and <a href=#>pre-save</a>.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Most Popular Country Album From the Year You Were Born</h2><p>Find out which country singer dominated on this list of the most popular albums from the year you were born or graduated high school.</p><p>This list is based on sales date from the Soundscan era (1991 to 2022) and total weeks spent atop Billboard's Hot Country Albums chart (1964-1990).</p>In 1999, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shania Twain</a>'s Come on Over album became the first to top the year-end chart in back-to-back years, but that feat has been done four times since, most recently in 2022.
