It is about his unrequited love for Mario’s love interest, Princess Peach. Because he’s a <a href=#>music</a> star in his own right, it’s no surprise Jack had a hand in writing the song, but unfortunately, it wasn’t enough to make the <a href=#>award show’s</a> shortlist for next year’s ceremony. And it’s safe to say people are conflicted over the decision.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1478876253-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-people-are-torn-about-jack-black-not-receiving-an-oscar-nomination>People are torn about Jack Black not receiving an Oscar nomination</h2><p>Taking to X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) people were quick to react to the fact Jack Black hadn’t received an Oscar nomination. They felt he should be recognized in the Best Original Song category, with many saying it was either better, or worse, than <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>‘s I’m Just Ken. The hit song from <a href=#>Barbie</a> has made the shortlist.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Robin Williams’ film Jumanji thankfully dodged ‘crazy’ sequel idea</a></p><p>One penned: “This song deserved not only to be nominated but also win. They robbed Jack.”</p><p>Another person wrote: “Let’s be serious, this song is not good.”</p><p>A third added: “Jack was robbed.”</p><p>Someone else posted: “The song is horrible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-peaches-peaches-peaches-and-a-tiktok-trend>Peaches, Peaches, Peaches – and a TikTok trend</h2><p>The film’s composer, Brian Tyler, who has written music for blockbusters such as Iron Man 3 and the latest Scream installments, praised the <a href=#>celebrity</a>. He said: “The less he thinks about it, the funnier it is.”</p><p>“That was pretty much Jack. He is so good at that stuff. I’m a big&nbsp;Tenacious D&nbsp;fan as well,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. Tenacious D is Jack’s band, they have been performing together for nearly 30 years.</p><p>“I can sing all their songs. I was talking to him about the song, like, ‘Do you just come up with that stuff, lyrically and everything, on the fly? I’m wondering if that’s how Tenacious D skits happen.’ That is what he does.”</p><p>Brian added: “For doing the piano and all that stuff, it’s him being able to riff and almost the less he thinks about it, the funnier it is. The fact that [he keeps repeating the word ‘Peaches’] is funny because it’s almost like Bowser couldn’t think of any lyrics. So he just repeats her name.”</p><p>He continued by saying Jack Black’s performance of the song, which failed to get a 2024 Oscar nomination, was “absurd”.</p><p>“And he’s a f***ing amazing singer, too. So, yeah — leave that to Jack, man,” Brian concluded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jack-was-hesitant-about-recording-the-song>Jack was hesitant about recording the song</h2><p>Jack Black, 54, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> he wasn’t sure if he wanted to record Peaches at first due to being “protective” of his music career. He wasn’t keen on the “crossover” of having his characters sing.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Ooh, I don’t know.’ I’m very protective about my singing career with my band, Tenacious D. I try not to do too many crossovers where my characters sing unless … that’s what we set out to do. ‘Are we doing a musical? If we are, then I want to hear the music before I agree to do it,'” the Hollywood star explained.</p><p>“So I said, ‘Let me hear what you got, what do you got?’ They sent over this little song, and I just couldn’t deny that it was funny. I was like, ‘I get it. I see why you want Bowser to do this, tickling the ivories and singing a love song to Peaches.’ It was undeniable.”</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>Quentin Tarantino almost turned Star Trek into a ‘bloody Pulp Fiction version’</a></strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2d%2FcLbAnKJmmpyWsKx5wZ6gp59dqLu2rsGem2aZpGLBqbGMqKqcmaKoeqq%2FjKympp2knbavs4yfmKerXau8uHnTqGSnnaaav26yzquenqxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-tomato-jellyfish-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>WHAT IS A TOMATO JELLYFISH?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-friends-stars-net-worths-68385.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Friends Cast Net Worths: Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
