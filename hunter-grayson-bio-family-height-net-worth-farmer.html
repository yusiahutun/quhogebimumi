He brings eight women to his homestead and chooses one of them to his liking! But don’t take our word for it. Watch Hunter Grayson do so in Fox’s new dating show </span><i><span>Farmer Wants a Wife</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>This Hunter Grayson Bio explores his life.</span></p><h3><b>Hunter Grayson On Farmer Wants A Wife</b></h3><p><span>It’s “nonsense” (as Ew.com labeled it) but interesting. Fox’s </span><i><span>Farmer Wants a Wife</span></i><span> is a reality dating show hosted by country star Jennifer Nettles. Here, 32 hopelessly single city women move to the countryside in hopes of finding love with one of the four farmers — Hunter Grayson, Ryan Black, Landon Heaton, and Allen Foster.</span></p><p><span>Each farmer will take eight women to his homestead for a chance at romance whilst struggling with the hassles of daily farm life —&nbsp; livestock, hay, and hard manual labor.</span></p><p><span>A short-lived U.S. version of </span><i><span>Farmer Wants a Wife</span></i><span> also aired on the CW back in 2008. So, a bold move to bring the show back after 15 years certainly means that </span><i><span>Farmer Wants a Wife</span></i><span> has stepped up its game.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about the single women competing to be Hunter’s wife, they come from different cities and work in a wide array of jobs. Namely, they are DeVonne (Director of marketing, from Scottsdale, AZ), Emma (Dance coach, from Pacific Palisades, CA), Hayley (HR manager, from Chicago, IL), Meghan (Event coordinator, from Midland, TX), Sarah R.

The star said that he was the best dad in the world.</span></p><p><span>Now, talking about Hunter’s sister Jessica Grayson Skelton, she’s married with a kid. “Even if she fusses at me about diabetes, or tattle tails on me at 5 am about a tattoo I didn’t even get! she’s a pretty cool sister to put up with me,” he summarized her.</span></p><p><span>Also, Hunter has two step-siblings named Brittany Ann, and Ricky Kyle Wood.
