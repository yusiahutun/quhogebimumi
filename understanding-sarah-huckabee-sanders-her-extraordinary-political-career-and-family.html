Former campaign manager and political advisor Sanders took over in July 2017 when Sean Spicer resigned. Sarah Huckabee was named one of the 40 under 40 in Time politics in 2010. She is a fan of fantasy football, New Kids On The Block, and the television show Mad Men.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders Early Life And Political Career</strong></h2><p>Sarah Huckabee Sanders was born into a politically oriented family on August 13, 1982. Her father, Mike Huckabee, was Governor of Arkansas and a two-term presidential candidate for the Republican Party. She is the youngest child and the only daughter in the family with two older brothers, John Mark, and David Huckabee.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>A Closer Look At Lisa Bonet’s Children, Husband, and Parents</a></strong></p><p>She attended Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, and is enrolled at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, which also happens to be her father’s alma mater. Through her activism in school, Sarah was soon elected Student Body President but was also active in Republican organizations and many other groups before graduating in 2004.</p><p>Huckabee was introduced to politics as a child when her father ran for the United States Senate in 1992. The election campaign was unsuccessful, she had described the campaign to “The Hill” and explained that her father did not have a lot of staff, so the family had to get involved and support him. Her father also described her childhood as one in which she sat at the kitchen table listening to political commentators analyze polls instead of jumping rope, like most children her age would do.</p><p>She began her political career as a field coordinator for her father’s 2002 re-election campaign for the governor of Arkansas, and after graduating in 2004, Sarah Huckabee moved to Washington and took a position in the Department of Education under the Bush administration. She also worked as a field coordinator for President Bush’s re-election campaign in Ohio in 2004.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Appointment As White House Press Secretary</strong></h2><p>At the beginning of the Trump administration, Sanders was appointed deputy press secretary of the White House. During the Trump campaign, she had served as a senior communications consultant, focusing on the formulation of messages and the involvement of support groups for Mr. Trump. She was responsible for communications with coalition groups that included faith leaders, military groups, and supporters of gun rights.</p><p>As Assistant Press Secretary of the White House, Sarah Huckabee held her first press conference at the White House on May 5, 2017, leaving for Sean Spicer, who served in the Naval Reserve. After the dismissal of James Comey, she was reinstated for Sean Spicer due to the controversy that followed. During this time, Sarah’s defense of the Trump administration’s actions led to speculation that Trump was considering promoting her for Spicer’s position.</p><p>On July 21, 2017, after Spicer announced his resignation, the newly appointed White House Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, announced Sanders as the new White House Press Secretary. This made her the third woman in history to hold the position, after Dee Dee Myers in 1993 and Dana Perino in 2007.</p><p>Sarah Huckabee shares President Trump’s contempt for the media, particularly CNN. During a press conference at the White House, she once accused journalists of disseminating fake news, arguing that Americans deserve better. More recently, in January 2018, in defense of President Trump, she had criticized media networks that repeatedly complained about his mental health and cognition.</p><p>After nearly two years in that office, Sanders resigned from her position as White House Press Secretary effective June 30, 2019. Since she left the White House, Sarah has been working as a Fox News staffer. She was touted as a possible candidate for the office of governor of Arkansas to follow in her father’s footsteps. She has yet to make a formal declaration to run, but all indications are that her retirement to her state is a good condition for her candidacy.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>The Reality of Nelly’s Relationship With His Girlfriend and How He Got His Kids</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family Life</strong></h2><p>Sarah is married to Bryan Chatfield Sanders, a political strategist she met during her father’s 2008 presidential campaign. While Sarah worked as a national political director on her father’s presidential campaign, Bryan was hired as a media consultant. They finally married Lutheran Chur on 25 May 2010 in Nazareth Lutheran Church in Cruz Bay on St. John’s Island in the U.S. Virgins Islands. Together they have three children.</p><p>To become part of the Trump administration, Sarah Huckabee Sanders had to move with her young family, her husband Bryan Sanders, and their three children (Scarlett Wiles, George, and William Huckabee Sanders) to Washington, where they currently live.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders Fact Card</strong></h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Second Street Strategies</strong></h3><p>In February 2016, Sarah Huckabee and her husband, Bryan Sanders, founded Second Street Strategies in Little Rock, Arkansas. Second Street Strategies is a consulting firm that provides general consulting services for Republican campaigns. She was also the Vice President of Tsamoutales Strategies, a consulting firm for business, management, and government.</p><p>Huckabee has worked as a political consultant on several campaigns. She was the national political director for her father’s 2008 presidential campaign, and Sarah Huckabee led the successful 2010 Republican candidacy of Arkansas Republican John Boozman for the Senate. She was also the senior advisor to former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty on his 2012 presidential candidacy and Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on the 2014 election. Sarah was the national campaign manager for ONE Campaign, the international organization dedicated to ending global poverty and preventable disease.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kwq%2BwxKuqrZmembavs4ysmKuZmGK1tq%2FKmpmenV2orq%2BwxKuqZqCVp3qmxNOrmKiqlJ67or7YZqeopJmptqSty2aamqqVmr9urc2dZJ%2BZnZ65uns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-cast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Voices Miles Morales, Spider Gwen?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rhobh-kyle-richards-reveals-needed-freedom-space-husband-mauricio-umansky-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills: Kyle Richards reveals she needed 'freedom and some space' from hus</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
