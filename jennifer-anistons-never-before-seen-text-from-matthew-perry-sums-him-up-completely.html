After <a href=#>Matthew Perry</a>‘s death, they released a joint statement explaining they’ll say more when ‘they’re able to’.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1385223704-705x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-aniston-pens-emotional-tribute-to-matthew-perry>Jennifer Aniston pens emotional tribute to Matthew Perry</h2><p>Taking to her 44.4 million <a href=#>Instagram</a> followers, Aniston posted an emotional tribute to her late co-star. It comes one day after <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc posted in Perry’s honor</a>.</p><p>Along with a black-and-white photo of the two smiling and laughing at each other, the 54-year-old penned: “Oh boy this one has cut deep… Having to say goodbye to our Matty has been an insane wave of emotions that I’ve never experienced before.</p><p>“We all experience loss at some point in our lives. Loss of life or loss of love. Being able to really SIT in this grief allows you to feel the moments of joy and gratitude for having loved someone that deep.”</p><p>She then went on to write about how the 6 of the Friends cast were family.</p><p>“And we loved him deeply. He was such a part of our DNA. We were always the 6 of us,” Jen continued. “This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be.</p><p>“For Matty, he KNEW he loved to make people laugh. As he said himself, if he didn’t hear the ‘laugh’ he thought he was going to die. His life literally depended on it. And boy did he succeed in doing just that. He made all of us laugh. And laugh hard.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-aniston-shares-never-before-seen-private-texts-from-matthew-perry>Jennifer Aniston shares never-before-seen private texts from Matthew Perry</h2><p>In the second slide, <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> shared a screenshot of one of their text message exchanges. He sent her the picture she posted as tribute, along with the words: “Making you laugh just made my day. It made my day :),” to which she responded: “Awww the first of THOUSANDS of times.”</p><p>She referenced the text message in the lengthy caption, as she wrote: “In the last couple weeks, I’ve been pouring over our texts to one another. Laughing and crying then laughing again. I’ll keep them forever and ever. I found one text that he sent me out of nowhere one day. It says it all. (See the second slide…)”</p><p>Of course, she had to end the emotional speech with a Friends reference, as she penned: “Matty, I love you so much and I know you are now completely at peace and out of any pain. I talk to you every day… sometimes I can almost hear you saying ‘could you BE any crazier?’ Rest little brother. You always made my day…”</p><p>In the last slide, the star, who apparently has <a href=#>been ‘reeling’ since Matthew’s death</a>, posted a video of the iconic goodbye between Rachel and Chandler when she’s going off to Paris. Of course, we know she didn’t get on the plane to be with her on-off-again partner, Ross, played by <a href=#>David Schwimmer</a>.</p><p>Fans took to the comment of the post, to share their tributes, and they were in tears all over again, as one penned: “Oh my Goddesss, @jenniferaniston … you KNOW love like yours is forever.”</p><p>“We love you Jenn. This tribute hit exceptionally hard for me. Forever my favorite tv and real-life friendship,” penned another.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-co-stars-were-especially-close>The co-stars were especially close</h2><p>Although all six co-stars had, and still have, a special bond, Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston had an extremely close connection, as sources said she was finding it hard after his death.</p><p>During filming, when he was struggling with alcohol and drug addiction, Perry revealed how it was <a href=#>Aniston who confronted him</a> and checked on him the most.</p><p>Perry had also admitted to having a crush on Jennifer. In his memoir, he thanked her for “letting me look at that face an extra two seconds every single day.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aCcLbEp6WinpWneqK6yKyrqKajYrumwsSrZJudlqS%2FpnnSnpynZaSaxbV5xaumpmWdlsG1tMSwZKmdoqfGbr%2FUpqpmoJmiera8jJympqicmsGmuNho</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./willie-nelson-kris-kristofferson-merle-haggard-roger-miller-tribute-album.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nelson, Kristofferson and Haggard Do Roger Miller Proud</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./301008-heather-storm-bio-age-marital-status-measurements-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Heather Storm bio, age, marital status, measurements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
