He began training as an officer during World War I but the conflict had ended before he could be sent to the front. He went on to study agriculture and for a short while was a chicken farmer.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>He joined Hitler's fledgling Nazi party and soon became a trusted aide and even towards the end of the war the German leader referred to him as 'der treue Heinrich' (the loyal Heinrich).</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/02/17/article-1357847-02728DEE000005DC-9_634x370.jpg height=370 width=634 alt="The face of evil: From left, Heinrich Himmler, Viktor Lutze, Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess, and Julius Streicher, in the Luitpoldhalle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Leading members of the Nazi Party two years before the outbreak of World War II.

Himmler was among a group of German soldiers captured after the Nazi surrender - disguised in a sergeant's uniform with a patch over one eye.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>But his ruse was blown by the soldiers who told their British captors of his presence.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>After his death, and under the&nbsp; cover of darkness, Himmler was buried in an unmarked grave on Luneburg Heath, in northern Germany. Those who buried him were made to sign the Official Secrets Act and told never to speak of the matter again.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The episode has been classified by the Ministry of Defence until 2045 - 100 years after the event.</span><br><span>Adderley, who died in his late 80s, was the photographer detailed to take the official pictures of Himmler's body after he took his own life.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The mystery surrounding Himmler's death on May 23, 1945, has been compounded by the covert way in which four British soldiers took his body from the Luneburg safe house, bundled it into an Army truck and secretly buried it in an unmarked grave on windswept Luneburg Heath. It has never been found.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>In 1945 disillusioned Himmler believed victory had slipped from Germany's grasp and secretly attempted to start peace negotiations with Eisenhower in a bid to escape a war crimes trial.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>But Eisenhower refused to have anything to do with Himmler. A furious Hitler declared Himmler a traitor, stripped him of his powers and the SS chief went on the run.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>When Himmler was arrested by the British at Bremervoerde on May 22, 1945, he had disguised himself by shaving off his moustache, wearing an eye patch over his left eye and he was carrying false identity papers.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Lance Cpl Adderley's collection includes a photocopied statement describing how Himmler was handed over to British intelligence chief Major Michael Murphy who had him driven to the safe house at Luneburg for interrogation.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>Adderley's statement reads: 'Presented by Cpl Adderley. For the record.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>'Himmler was captured by and remained in the care of Guy Adderley, who handled him correctly and so was quite composed at that stage.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>'The trick was to keep the prisoner so until the poison pill secreted between his teeth could be removed.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>'A senior staff officer took control of the situation from Guy Adderley, with much noise and ceremony.</span><br><span>'Himmler became alarmed, crunched the poison pill, and that was the end of the story.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>'This photograph was taken while he was still warm.'</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2BdIGWcWtwZ4CesLXB0Z5kgZ2Zo7%2Bqr8dmf6KlnaGys3nTmqKepl2ivK6xza2qZqulnrCqsMRmqpqklWO1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zainab-johnson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Zainab Johnson dating?
