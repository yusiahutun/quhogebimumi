"There was a period of time before he grew up -- when he was foolish, and doing foolish things."</p><p>"I must have said something about it, and then, I understood that he was paying the front door people to let them know when I was there, coming and going, so he wouldn't have to bump into me," she added with a laugh.</p><p><a href=#>TooFab </a>has reached out to Bieber's reps for comment.</p><p>Judge Judy shared her thoughts about Bieber following his DUI arrest in 2014.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fb9709a0-b694-4d46-8bae-eb2c17254133 data-container-ref=toofab:article:0c69eb7d-23b6-4f90-b22a-c40b1853535b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4c/5by4/2022/10/16/4c031c9682fc434c88f0269cdb6f6bc8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">What Feud? -- Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez All Smiles Together at Academy Museum Gala</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Being a celebrity is a gift," she said to CBS Los Angeles at the time, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "You could either treat it reverently or you could make a fool out of yourself. And he's doing a very good job of making a fool out of himself."</p><p>"I think it's sad," she continued, adding, "And nobody's going to remember that he was a marginal singer. But they're going to remember a young kid who had a chance to have it all and who is blowing it by acting like a fool."</p><p>Meanwhile, also during her new interview with Access Hollywood, Judge Judy opened up about her future as a TV judge, explaining why she doesn't plan on saying goodbye anytime soon.</p><p>"If you find something that you're naturally good at, and can figure out a way to make a living [out of] it, you never work," said Judge Judy -- who was promoting "Judy Justice" Season 2 -- "I love what I do every day. I don't play golf. I don't play mahjong. I don't play tennis. There's nothing that I enjoy more than this."</p><p>"I've had a terrific run and I don't expect this to be over for a long time," she added.</p><a id=gallery-link-f3956191-d02d-4d9a-ab19-b3352348b54f class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f3956191-d02d-4d9a-ab19-b3352348b54f data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:0c69eb7d-23b6-4f90-b22a-c40b1853535b data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ee/4by3/2022/11/07/eec3d1e1890e4a9f838239c99d892765_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGpmaXFfn8Kls8Rmoa6cqWK3tr%2FToqVmmpmar6a%2BjKyamqqVmXq1u4ydnJqsmGK8p3nHnqlo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kylie-minogue-fans-left-concerned-cryptic-message.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kylie Minogue fans left concerned after Paul Solomons shares cryptic message</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celine-dion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How many kids does Celine Dion have, Relationship, Married, Wheelchair, Net Worth, Children, Sibling</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./marco-pasternak-better-call-saul-character-profile.html>Marco Pasternak: Better Call Saul character profile</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./truck-vs-person-crash-off-n-division-st-in-davenport.html>Police investigate fatal crash off North Division Street, Davenport</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./grant-chestnu.html>Who is American Actor Grant Chestnut?
