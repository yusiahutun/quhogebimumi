An invigorated Miko even joined&nbsp;CGB (Complete Game Broadcasting) in Atlanta to further her credentials.</p><p style=text-align:justify>After CGB, she worked as a sideline reporter for Morehouse College as well as Atlanta University while co-hosting a sports-talk radio program on 790 The Zone. It was during this period, Miko met her future husband (more on that later). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Today, she's a celebrated chef and a socialite with a sky-rocketing net worth - a sum which would've grown exponentially, had she not given up her lucrative career for more family time with her husband, Brent Grimes, who garners a reported net worth of $8 million.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Thought Husband Was Gay</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Miko and her husband, Brent met each other while the latter was still with Atlanta Falcons. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Couple Who Met While At Work:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Graham Phillips Spotted With Ariana Grande, Dating Again?" rel=follow>Graham Phillips Spotted With Ariana Grande, Dating Again?</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Contrary to how compatible they look today, the married duo didn't hit it off at the start.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The retired journo even questioned her then-boyfriend Brent's sexuality after he failed to make advances following a month of dating. She once explained:-</p><p style=text-align:justify>“We were going out for a month, and he wouldn’t kiss me, wouldn’t grab my ass, wouldn’t do anything guys do. I thought: It’s Atlanta; lots of guys here have beards. And I’m a tomboy. Maybe he thought I’d be cool with that.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>So thrown off was Miko with her NFL star beau that she didn't even return his calls.
