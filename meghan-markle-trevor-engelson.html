Following their divorce, the 44-year-old producer went on to marry Tracey Kurland, a 34-year-old nutritionist, in May 2019. The couple welcomed their first daughter, Ford Grace Engelson, just over a year later in August 2020. Now, the pair are expecting another baby girl, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>While congratulations are surely in order, Trevor and Tracey may not be hearing any from the Duchess of Sussex. According to a source who previously spoke to the magazine in 2019, Trevor and Meghan “no longer speak” following their split. The film and TV executive “doesn’t really think about Meghan” anymore, the insider added at the time, noting, “He’s in a very happy relationship.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/do-harry-william-talk.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meghan-markle-king-charles.png><p>Meghan, meanwhile, went on to marry Prince Harry in May 2018.
